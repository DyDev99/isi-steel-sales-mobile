/// Writes `assets/mock/products.json`, the demo catalog dataset that
/// `MockProductRemoteDataSource` simulates syncing from.
///
/// Run with: `dart run tool/generate_mock_products.dart [--seed=7]`
///
/// **This is not optional after editing the mock data.**
/// `MockProductRemoteDataSource` only falls back to `MockProductData` in
/// memory when the asset is *missing*. Change `isi_demo_catalog.dart` or
/// `mock_product_data.dart`, rebuild without re-running this, and the app
/// keeps serving the previous catalog from the committed JSON — which looks
/// exactly like "my changes didn't work".
///
/// Row count isn't a direct parameter — it falls out of `MockProductData`'s
/// composed generators:
///
///  * `IsiDemoCatalog` contributes a fixed 60 rows (10 categories x 6
///    hand-picked real SKUs), the set the guided configurator is walked
///    against;
///  * [ProductGenerator] / [VariantGenerator] / [WarehouseGenerator]
///    contribute the traded catalog — 113 families x 5-80 variants x 2-4
///    warehouses each, ~11,000 rows.
///
/// The same generators scale to millions on a real backend without this
/// script changing shape.
///
/// Two invariants are checked after writing, because both have already been
/// broken once and neither fails loudly on its own:
///
///  1. **Total rows land in the 10k-30k band** the paging and scroll
///     performance tests are calibrated against. Trimming a brand list or a
///     rating series can quietly drop the fixture under that floor.
///  2. **No `cat_isi_*` category id collides with a generated one.** Facet
///     options are `SELECT DISTINCT` aggregates scoped to a category, so a
///     single generated row landing in a demo category injects invented
///     values into the guided flow and destroys the "six SKUs, walkable by
///     hand" property the demo catalog exists to provide. This one is
///     invisible in the JSON and only shows up as a picker that offers
///     gauges no demo SKU has.
///
/// The file is written before validation runs, so a failure still leaves the
/// output on disk to inspect. Exit code is non-zero so CI notices.
