# Search Customers — Mobile

**Purpose:** free-text customer search for the Flutter field sales app.
**Scope:** the `search` parameter on `GET /api/v1/mobile/customers`.
**Status:** Active · **Last updated:** 2026-08-28

Search is not a separate endpoint. It is one parameter on the list endpoint, so
every filter, sort and paging rule in [filter-customer.md](filter-customer.md)
applies unchanged to a search result.

## The request

```
GET /api/v1/mobile/customers?search=ដេប៉ូ%20តាំង&pageSize=25
Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
Accept-Language: km-KH
```

`search` is a single free-text term. There is no field-qualified syntax
(`name:foo`), no boolean operator and no wildcard character — the server wraps the
term in `%…%` itself. A term containing `%` or `_` is treated literally.

Response is the ordinary list envelope. `metadata.totalRecords` is the match count,
so a "1,965 results" header costs nothing extra.

---

## What is searched

Seven columns, OR-ed together:

| Column | Matched as | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `name` | contains, case-insensitive | Legal / registered name |
| `nameEn` | contains, case-insensitive | English trading name — what `shopName` renders under `en-US` |
| `nameKm` | contains | Khmer shopfront name — what `shopName` renders under `km-KH` |
| `code` | contains, case-insensitive | Customer number, so a partial paste works |
| `city` | contains, case-insensitive | "Phnom Penh" narrows to a city |
| `sapCustomerId` | contains, case-insensitive | The ERP number when it differs from `code` |
| `phone` | contains | Digits as stored — see below |

**All three name columns are searched, not just the legal name.** This matters more
than it sounds. In the current production extract 5,956 of 6,010 customers have a
Khmer name that differs from their legal name, and `shopName` — the field the list
screen actually renders — comes from `nameKm` under a Khmer locale. Searching only
the legal name meant a representative could read a shop's name off the screen, type
it back, and get nothing.

### Phone matching is on stored digits

Phone numbers are normalised on write: formatting is stripped and only digits and a
leading `+` survive. `012 345 678` is stored as `012345678`. Searching `012 345`
therefore does **not** match, because the space is still in your term.

Strip non-digits client-side before searching a phone number:

```dart
final term = looksLikePhone(input) ? input.replaceAll(RegExp(r'[^0-9+]'), '') : input;
```

### Not searched

`ownerName` (contact person), `territory`, `district`, `province`, contact names, and
the SAP classification codes. Filter on `territory` / `district` / `province`
instead — they are exact-match parameters, which is both faster and unambiguous.

---

## Khmer search and why it needs care

Two properties of the SAP master data shape how this works.

### 1. Zero-width characters

SAP's Khmer names carry zero-width spaces and joiners as word-break hints. In the
current extract **1,130 of 5,990 Khmer names contain at least one**. They are
invisible on screen, and a representative reading a name and typing it back cannot
reproduce them:

```
stored    ដេប៉ូ<ZWSP><ZWSP><ZWSP> រស្មី សៀមរាប
typed     ដេប៉ូ រស្មី សៀមរាប
```

A naive `LIKE` fails on that. The server therefore strips `U+200B`, `U+200C` and
`U+200D` from **both** the search term and the three name columns before comparing,
in SQL. You do not need to pre-process the term — but you must not "helpfully"
insert or preserve them either. Send what the user typed.

### 2. Khmer has no letter case

Lower-casing is a no-op for Khmer script, so case-insensitivity is a property of the
Latin columns only. Nothing for the client to do; it is noted because it explains why
the same code path serves both scripts.

### Verified behaviour

| Term | Results | Note |
|---|---|---|
| `ដេប៉ូ` | 2,552 | The word "depot" — very common |
| `ដេប៉ូ តាំង` | 33 | Two words, matched across a stored zero-width space |
| `រស្មី សៀមរាប` | 1 | Matched a name stored with three zero-width spaces |
| `DEPOT` | 2,612 | The Latin equivalent, from `nameEn` |
| `6100000017` | 1 | Exact customer number |

## Flow: SAP → backend → mobile

Search runs entirely against the platform database. SAP is never consulted on the
search path — but SAP is where the searchable text comes from.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    participant SAP as SAP ERP
    participant Job as Nightly sync job
    participant DB as PostgreSQL
    participant API as ISI API
    participant App as Flutter app

    Note over SAP,DB: Ingestion — once a night, 02:00 UTC
    Job->>SAP: GET /api/Customer/GetCustByPaging/{conId}
    SAP-->>Job: rows (customer × sales area × company code)
    Job->>Job: collapse duplicate customer numbers
    Job->>DB: upsert name, name_en, name_km, code, city, phone…

    Note over App,DB: Search — online, per keystroke (debounced)
    App->>API: GET /mobile/customers?search=ដេប៉ូ
    API->>API: strip zero-width chars from the term
    API->>DB: WHERE LOWER(REPLACE(name_km,…)) LIKE '%…%' OR (name_en…) OR …
    DB-->>API: matching page
    API->>API: project to summary, localise statusDisplay
    API-->>App: envelope + metadata.totalRecords
```

Three consequences worth designing around:

- **A customer created in SAP today is not searchable until the next sync runs.**
  For that case use [by-code lookup](#not-found-locally-fall-back-to-by-code), which
  does reach SAP.
- **Search needs connectivity.** It is a server query, not a local one. For offline
  search, run it against the device's own synced copy — see
  [get-customer.md](get-customer.md) for how to build that copy.
- **The text SAP sends is the text you search.** Names arrive as the ERP holds them,
  including the `(No Use)` and `(NO USE)` prefixes on retired records. Filter those
  out with `status` if they should not appear.

---

## Combining search with filters

`search` AND-s with every other parameter. This is the useful pattern for a field
app — narrow to the rep's own active customers, then search within them:

```
GET /api/v1/mobile/customers
      ?search=ដេប៉ូ
      &status=Active
      &territory=PP-CENTRAL
      &pageSize=25
```

Sorting also applies. Note that results are **not** ranked by relevance — there is no
scoring. Ordering is whatever `sort` says, defaulting to `createdAt`. If you want the
closest match first you must rank client-side within the page.

---

## Client implementation

```dart
class CustomerSearch {
  CustomerSearch(this._api);
  final Dio _api;

  Timer? _debounce;
  CancelToken? _inFlight;

  /// Debounced, cancelling. Khmer input arrives one cluster at a time, so an
  /// un-debounced search fires several requests per visible character.
  void onChanged(String raw, void Function(List<CustomerSummary>, int) onResult) {
    _debounce?.cancel();
    _debounce = Timer(const Duration(milliseconds: 350), () async {
      final term = raw.trim();

      // Below two characters the result set is most of the table; not worth a round trip.
      if (term.length < 2) return onResult(const [], 0);

      _inFlight?.cancel('superseded');
      _inFlight = CancelToken();

      try {
        final res = await _api.get(
          '/mobile/customers',
          queryParameters: {
            'search': _normalise(term),
            'pageSize': 25,
            'status': 'Active',       // omit if retired records should show
          },
          cancelToken: _inFlight,
        );
        final body = res.data;
        onResult(
          [for (final c in body['data']['customers']) CustomerSummary.fromJson(c)],
          body['metadata']['totalRecords'],
        );
      } on DioException catch (e) {
        if (!CancelToken.isCancel(e)) rethrow;   // ignore superseded requests
      }
    });
  }

  /// Only phone-looking input is rewritten. Khmer and Latin text is sent verbatim —
  /// the server does the zero-width normalisation.
  String _normalise(String term) =>
      RegExp(r'^[\d\s+()-]{6,}$').hasMatch(term)
          ? term.replaceAll(RegExp(r'[^0-9+]'), '')
          : term;
}
```

Points that matter in the field:

- **Debounce 300–400 ms.** A Khmer keyboard commits a cluster at a time; each commit
  is a change event.
- **Cancel the superseded request.** On a 3G link responses arrive out of order, and
  without cancellation an older response can overwrite a newer one.
- **Two-character minimum.** `ដ` matches thousands of rows.
- **Show `totalRecords`, page the rest.** Do not fetch 2,552 rows to display a count.

## Not found locally? Fall back to by-code

When a representative types a full customer number and search returns nothing, the
number may have been created in SAP since the last sync. `GET /customers/by-code/{code}`
checks the database first and asks SAP only on a miss, storing whatever it finds:

```dart
Future<Customer?> resolve(String code) async {
  final hits = await search(code);
  if (hits.isNotEmpty) return hits.first;

  // Portal surface: different envelope and a different customer shape.
  final res = await _api.get('/customers/by-code/$code',
      options: Options(validateStatus: (s) => s == 200 || s == 404));
  return res.statusCode == 404 ? null : PortalCustomer.fromJson(res.data['data']);
}
```

Only on an explicit full-code lookup. Never on the keystroke path — it can reach out
to the ERP, and it answers with the **portal** envelope (`data` + `meta`), not the
mobile one, so it needs its own parser.

---

## Performance

Search is a sequential scan with `LIKE '%term%'` over the name columns. No B-tree
index can serve a leading wildcard, and the zero-width stripping wraps the columns in
`REPLACE`, which would defeat one anyway. At 6,010 customers that is comfortably
fast.

If the table grows past a few tens of thousands of rows, the fix is a trigram index
in a migration:

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pg_trgm;
CREATE INDEX ix_customers_name_km_trgm
  ON customers USING gin (lower(replace(name_km, U&'\200B', '')) gin_trgm_ops);
```

Measure first — a GIN index is not free to maintain, and the nightly sync writes
every row.

## Checklist

- [ ] Debounced 300–400 ms
- [ ] Superseded requests cancelled
- [ ] Two-character minimum before calling
- [ ] Khmer and Latin terms sent verbatim — no client-side zero-width handling
- [ ] Phone-shaped input stripped to digits before sending
- [ ] `Accept-Language` sent, so `shopName` and search agree on which name they mean
- [ ] `metadata.totalRecords` used for the count, not `customers.length`
- [ ] Results paged, not fetched whole
- [ ] No relevance assumed — order comes from `sort`
- [ ] by-code fallback only on a full-code lookup, with its own parser
