> **Parts of it are superseded.** The backend now owns the arithmetic it describes:
>
> | This document says | What the server does now |
> |---|---|
> | Rep line discount `0% – 10%` | The limit is served by `GET /api/v1/mobile/me/discount-authority` (3% by default) and enforced server-side. Exceeding it is *accepted* and escalates |
> | Manual USD price override when unpriced | Refused. The quotation API prices every line from SAP; a SAP outage answers `502`, never an input box |
> | Free-goods ladder evaluated on the phone | Not built anywhere. `POST /promotions/evaluate` does not exist |
> | On-invoice depot discount as a client-side scheme | Applied by the server from an **effective** agreement term, and never from an approved-but-unconfirmed one |
> | COD / Pickup as one discount | Two different things. Pickup is who moves the goods; COD is how the customer pays. Only pickup earns the rate |
>
> For the endpoints and their actual behaviour see [../api/mobile.md](../api/mobile.md);

## 1. Overview & Business Purpose

In ISI Steel sales operations, **promotions** and **discounts** represent distinct commercial incentives governed by separate business rules, approval processes, and accounting impacts.

```

The system enforces three fundamental rules across the mobile application:

1. **Free goods are never converted into cash discounts:**  
   Free units (e.g., *Buy 40 sheets, get 1 free*) are tracked as physical items and physical deliverables. They are never deducted from unit prices or subtotal calculations.
2. **Discounts reduce taxable subtotal before tax calculation:**  
   Both line-level SKU discounts and invoice-level term discounts reduce the gross subtotal to produce the net taxable base.
3. **Strict separation of discount origins:**  
   Sales reps, customers, and accounting can clearly inspect whether a price reduction originated from a line-item rep discretion, a depot campaign, an order fulfillment term (pickup vs. delivery), or an approved price request.

## 2. Core Concepts & Taxonomy

| Term / Mechanism | Domain / Scope | Value Type | Impact on Invoice / Quotation |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Rep Line Discount** | SKU / Line Item | Percentage (`0% – 10%`) | Reduces SKU line total: `lineTotal = (qty * unitPrice) * (1 - rate)` |
| **Manual Price Override** | SKU / Line Item | USD Unit Price | Replaces catalog/backend price when unpriced by HQ (`isManualPrice: true`) |
| **Free Goods Ladder** | SKU / Category | Integer Units (`buyXGetY`) | Awards free quantity; adds bonus note; zero impact on line price |
| **On-Invoice Depot Discount** | Category / Depot | Percentage / Fixed USD | Aggregated under Invoice Discounts in summary breakdown |
| **COD / Pickup Discount** | Order / Shipment | Percentage (e.g., `1%`) | Dynamic; earned **only** when `ShipmentMethod == pickup` |
| **Depot Request** | Outlet / Approval | Percentage (e.g., `1.5%`) | Pre-approval state (`pending`, `approved`); non-quotable until approved |

## 4. State Management & Data Flow

### 4.1 PromotionCubit (`lib/features/order/presentation/bloc/promotion/promotion_cubit.dart`)

- **State:** `Map<String, PromotionEvaluation>` keyed by `materialCode`.
- **Debounced Resolution:** Uses a `220ms` debounce timer matching quantity steppers to avoid flooding backend pricing/promotion services while the user adjusts quantities.
- **Customer Scoping:** `setCustomer(String? customerId)` resets all cached verdicts immediately to prevent negotiated terms from leaking between customers.

### 4.2 CartCubit (`lib/features/order/presentation/bloc/cart/cart_cubit.dart`)

- Tracks individual `CartItem` state.
- Stores `discountPercent` (rep discount).
- Stores `unitPriceOverride` and `isManualPrice` for lines requiring field-level pricing.
- Emits aggregated calculations:
  - `subtotal`: `sum(item.quantity * item.unitPrice)`
  - `discount`: `sum(item.lineDiscount)`
