## 0. Executive summary

| # | Area | Severity | Root cause (one line) | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Depot Stock blank/empty | **P0** | Local catalog empty + flow did a one-shot local read with no sync-on-empty and a dead empty state | ✅ **Fixed** |
| 2 | Check-In slow to appear | P1 | UI gates on first GPS fix / permission dialog + map init; not a blocked isolate | 📋 Roadmap |
| 3 | Cold start latency | P1 | Bootstrap awaits the legacy sqflite→Drift import + Hive init before `runApp`; first DB-touching screen pays SQLCipher open + migrations | 📋 Roadmap |
| 4 | Real-device jank | P2 | Shader compilation on first animation, unbounded shadows, whole-screen `BlocBuilder` rebuilds | 📋 Roadmap |
| — | **`cart_items.customization_json` migration** | **P1 (found incidentally)** | A Drift migration `ALTER TABLE cart_items ADD COLUMN customization_json` re-adds a column that already exists at that schema version → `duplicate column` | 🐞 **Flagged** |

**Verification note (honesty):** 10 tests in the suite fail with `duplicate column name: customization_json`.
I confirmed by `git stash` isolation that these fail **identically without my change** — they are a
pre-existing schema-migration defect (see §6), not a regression from the Depot Stock fix. My change
analyzes clean (`flutter analyze lib/features/my_visits` → *No issues*) and the order-feature datasource
tests pass in isolation.

## 1. ISSUE 1 — Depot Stock Root-Cause Report ✅ FIXED

### 1.1 Reproduction & symptom
Depot Stock → Select Depot → **Continue** → next screen shows no products, no error, no loading.

### 1.2 The flow (traced)
```
DepotSelectionScreen (customers load fine — selection works)
  └─ Continue → DepotStockCountScreen(shopId: <customerId>)   [MaterialPageRoute, correct arg]
       └─ DepotStockCountCubit.load(shopId)
            ├─ GetCustomerById(shopId)            → shopName   (OK — customers exist)
            └─ BrowseProducts(page:0, size:40)    → PagedResult<Product>
                 └─ ProductRepositoryImpl._browse → ProductDriftLocalDataSource.browse
                      └─ CatalogDao.browseProducts  → **local Products table**
```

### 1.3 Root cause (verified, not guessed)
The navigation arguments, bloc init, event sequence, local query, and mapper are all **correct**. The
defect is a **data-availability + offline-first-workflow** gap:

1. The local `Products` table is the sole source ([`product_repository_impl.dart`](../../lib/features/order/data/repositories/product_repository_impl.dart) — "every read here is local-only").
2. The **only** code that fills that table is [`SyncRepositoryImpl.runInitialSync`](../../lib/features/order/data/repositories/sync_repository_impl.dart#L43), which **requires network** (`if (!await _network.isConnected) return Failed(NetworkFailure())`) and is **triggered only from the Order catalog screen** — never at bootstrap, never from the Depot flow. There is **no offline seed**.
3. Therefore, if a rep opens Depot Stock **before** ever opening the Order catalog online — or after the DB was wiped (the self-heal that recovers a `SQLITE_NOTADB` file, `encrypted_database.dart`) — the catalog is empty. `BrowseProducts` returns an empty page → the cubit emitted `empty` → the screen rendered a **dead `_EmptyState`** with no message and no action.
4. The **truly blank** white screen in the original screenshots was the earlier `SqliteException(26)` DB-corruption (already fixed by the open/self-heal rewrite); after that fix it degraded to the dead empty state — still wrong per `docs/blueprint/offline-architecture.md` §1 and the issue's own requirement: *"If local data does not exist: show loading, synchronize, cache locally, display products. Never display an empty white screen."*

### 1.4 The fix (implemented)
`DepotStockCountCubit.load()` is now genuinely offline-first with **sync-on-empty**:

```
load(shopId)
  → emit loading
  → resolve customer (error state if missing)
  → READ LOCAL FIRST (instant, offline)
       • products present → loaded
       • local read failed (typed CacheFailure) → error + Retry
       • EMPTY →
            emit SYNCING  (skeletons + "Downloading product catalog…" — never blank)
            RunInitialSync(SyncScope.forCurrentUser(session))   // fills the catalog once
            re-read local
               • now present → loaded
               • still empty after a successful pull → genuine empty ("No inventory")
               • pull failed (offline) → actionable empty:
                    "Connect to the internet once to download the catalog" + Retry
```

Files changed (all presentation/DI/domain-usecase — no `core/`, no schema):
- [`depot_stock_count_cubit.dart`](../../lib/features/my_visits/presentation/bloc/cubit/depot_stock_count_cubit.dart) — sync-on-empty logic; injects the existing `RunInitialSync` usecase + `SessionManager`.
- [`depot_stock_count_state.dart`](../../lib/features/my_visits/presentation/bloc/state/depot_stock_count_state.dart) — new `syncing` status.
- [`depot_stock_count_screen.dart`](../../lib/features/my_visits/presentation/screens/inventory_visible/inventory_visible_screen.dart) — `syncing` renders the loading skeleton with a caption; empty state now takes a message + Retry.
- [`my_visits_injection.dart`](../../lib/features/my_visits/my_visits_injection.dart) — wires the two new deps.
- `assets/lang/{en,km}.json` — `my_visits.depot.syncing_catalog`, `my_visits.depot.catalog_offline`, `common.done` (1022/1022 parity).

**Why it's correct:** it reads local first (instant, no network on the happy path), only reaches for the
network when there is genuinely nothing to show, reuses the *existing* sync usecase (no new data path,
no cross-feature `data/` import — `RunInitialSync`/`SyncScope` are order **domain**), and every terminal
state is now meaningful (loaded / syncing / genuine-empty / offline-empty-with-retry / error-with-retry).

**Performance impact:** happy path unchanged (one local paged read). Empty path adds one guarded network
pull *only when the catalog is empty* — a one-time cost that then populates the catalog for the whole app.

**Risks:** the pull uses the mock remote today (real source blocked on `sap_client.dart`, ADR-009); when
the real SAP client lands, `RunInitialSync` already funnels through it, so no call-site change. A very
large first pull could make the first Depot open slow — mitigated by the skeleton + caption (perceived
progress, not a freeze).

**Testing strategy:** unit-test the cubit with mocked usecases for the four branches
(local-present, empty→sync-success→present, empty→sync-success→still-empty, empty→sync-fail→offline-empty);
widget-test the screen renders skeleton on `syncing` and Retry on both empty variants; offline/blackout
integration test per `docs/blueprint/offline-architecture.md` §6. (Depot Stock had **no** test before — adding one is a follow-up.)

## 2. ISSUE 2 — Check-In Performance Report 📋

### 2.1 Finding: the screen itself is *not* blocked
Contrary to the hypothesis, [`RouteCheckInScreen.initState`](../../lib/features/my_visits/presentation/screens/stops_check_in_screen.dart#L42) only does a light local `VisitCubit.load(stopId)`, and [`LocationTrackingCubit`](../../lib/features/my_visits/presentation/bloc/cubit/location_tracking_cubit.dart) does **not** start GPS in its constructor — `start()` is explicit and stream-based. There is no `Future.wait`, no synchronous camera/VPN/fraud init on the build path.

### 2.2 Real root causes of the perceived delay
1. **First-GPS-fix gate.** The check-in CTA unlocks on geofence proximity, which needs the first real GPS fix — cold GPS can take 2–8 s on a real device. In debug this is masked by `kDebugForceInsideGeofence = true` (`stops_check_in_screen.dart:28`), so it *feels* instant in-house and slow in the field. **`// TODO(release-gate):`** — this flag must be gated per `docs/skills/security.md` §11 and `docs/skills/engineering-standard.md` §11; it currently is not.
2. **Permission dialog** on first `LocationTrackingCubit.start()` (`ensurePermission`) stalls perceived readiness.
3. **`TransitMap` init** — a map tile/controller warm-up on entry.

### 2.3 Recommendation (roadmap, not done here)
Render the check-in scaffold + skeleton **immediately** (already close), and treat GPS/permission/map as
**progressive-enhancement overlays** with their own micro-states ("Getting your location…") rather than
gating the whole screen. Fix the geofence debug flag with a release-gate tag. Est. effort: M. Risk: touches
the live check-in workflow — needs blackout + geofence tests.

## 3. ISSUE 3 — Startup Analysis Report 📋

### 3.1 Boot sequence (traced, `app_bootstrap_service.dart`)
```
main() → AppBootstrapService.run():
  1. Hive.init()                         [awaited — required before DI/AppPreferences]
  2. initDependencies()                  [DI — almost all registerLazySingleton ✅ good]
  3. _importLegacyRoutes()               [AWAITED — sqflite open + read + Drift txn write]
  4. connectivity.start()                [async, non-blocking ✅ good]
  → runApp()
```
The encrypted `AppDatabase` is a `LazyDatabase` — it opens on **first use**, not at boot (good), but that
means the **first DB-touching screen** pays SQLCipher key-derivation + fail-closed pragma + Drift migrations
in one hit (janky first navigation).

### 3.2 Root causes
1. **Legacy import is on the critical path** (step 3, awaited before `runApp`). On a fresh install it fast-returns (`sourceMissing`), but on devices carrying `routes.db` it's real disk I/O before the first frame.
2. **Deferred DB cost is concentrated**, not amortized — the first screen that reads Drift triggers open + all pending migrations synchronously from the UI's perspective.
3. DI itself is lean (lazy) — **not** a startup cost. Good.

### 3.3 Recommendations (roadmap)
- Move the legacy import **off the pre-`runApp` path**: let the app render the splash/shell first, run the import as a post-first-frame background task (it already never blocks correctness — it's idempotent and retry-on-next-launch). Est: S–M. Risk: low (import is already crash-safe).
- **Warm the DB open** during the splash's idle window (a no-op query) so the first real screen doesn't pay it. Est: S.
- Add boot-phase timing logs (`AppLogger`) around Hive / DI / import / first-DB-open to get real numbers on device — **measure before optimizing further.** Est: S.

## 4. ISSUE 4 — Rendering / Widget-Rebuild Report 📋

### 4.1 Observations (static, from the graph + touched screens)
- **Whole-screen `BlocConsumer`/`BlocBuilder`** on some screens rebuild the entire body on any state change; the codebase mostly uses `buildWhen`/`BlocSelector` well (e.g. depot screen's bottom bar uses `buildWhen`), but a rebuild audit of the high-traffic screens (dashboard, pipeline board, catalog list) is warranted.
- **Shader jank**: first run of each Material animation compiles its shader on-device (the classic "smooth in emulator, janky on first real-device animation"). Ship **SkSL warm-up** (`flutter run --profile --cache-sksl` capture → bundle) — the single highest-ROI real-device smoothness fix.
- **Shadows/blur**: `BackdropFilter` (guest feature preview) and multi-layer `boxShadow` are expensive on mid-range Android; audit for over-draw.
- **Images**: ensure `cacheWidth`/`cacheHeight` on product/customer thumbnails so full-res images aren't decoded into small boxes.

### 4.2 Recommendation
Run `flutter run --profile` + DevTools timeline on a real mid-range Android for: cold start, catalog scroll,
tab transitions. Capture SkSL and bundle it. Est: M. This is measurement-first work — the above are
hypotheses to confirm with the timeline, not blind edits.

## 5. Offline-first validation (against `docs/blueprint/offline-architecture.md` §4)
- Depot Stock now conforms: **read local → render → sync-on-empty → refresh** (§1 pattern). ✅
- Customer/Catalog/Route/Visit read local-only via repositories (verified in the graph). ✅
- The **catalog seeding gap** (no offline seed; only online `runInitialSync`) is the systemic weakness — Depot Stock now works around it per-screen; the durable fix is a **bootstrap/first-run catalog hydration** so *every* catalog consumer benefits (roadmap, tied to the real `sap_client.dart`).

---

## 6. Incidental bug found — `cart_items.customization_json` migration 🐞
`flutter test test/core/database/drift/customer_sap_schema_migration_test.dart` fails **in isolation and
without any of my changes**:
```
SqliteException(1): duplicate column name: customization_json
Causing statement: ALTER TABLE "cart_items" ADD COLUMN "customization_json" TEXT NULL;
```
A migration step adds `customization_json` to `cart_items` that **already exists** at the target schema
version (double-add, or added in both `onCreate` and an `onUpgrade` step). This is a `core/database`
high-bar defect (`docs/skills/ai-engineering-playbook.md` §3) and a **data-migration correctness** risk on real
upgrades, not just tests. **Recommend a dedicated fix PR** with a migration test proving upgrade
idempotency (`docs/blueprint/local-storage-architecture.md` §5). Out of scope for this Depot Stock task, but flagged rather than
silently ignored (`docs/skills/engineering-standard.md` §11).

## 7. Optimization roadmap (prioritized)
| Priority | Item | Effort | Risk | Measure of success |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| P0 ✅ | Depot Stock sync-on-empty | done | low | No blank screen; products or actionable state always |
| P1 | Fix `cart_items.customization_json` migration + idempotency test | S | med (schema) | Migration suite green |
| P1 | Move legacy import off pre-`runApp` path + DB warm-up on splash | S–M | low | Cold start < 2 s (measured) |
| P1 | Check-in: skeleton-first + progressive GPS/permission overlays + gate debug geofence flag | M | med (workflow) | Check-in visible < 300 ms |
| P2 | SkSL shader warm-up bundle | M | low | No first-animation jank on real device |
| P2 | Rebuild audit (dashboard/board/catalog) with `BlocSelector`/`buildWhen` | M | low | No whole-screen rebuilds in timeline |
| P2 | Image decode sizing (`cacheWidth/Height`) | S | low | Lower memory on catalog scroll |
| P3 | Boot-phase timing instrumentation | S | none | Real per-phase numbers to guide further work |

**Guiding rule honored throughout:** root cause before code; the one change shipped here is the one with a
verified root cause and a contained blast radius. The rest are measurement-first roadmap items, deliberately
not blind-rewritten.
