## Start here

| You are… | Read this |
|---|---|
| An engineer making your first change | [skills/engineering-standard.md](skills/engineering-standard.md) → [skills/ai-engineering-playbook.md](skills/ai-engineering-playbook.md) |
| Building or changing **any** UI | [skills/feature-ui-standard.md](skills/feature-ui-standard.md) — this is a merge gate, not advice |
| An AI coding agent orienting in the repo | [blueprint/feature-architecture.md](blueprint/feature-architecture.md), then the feature's own `README.md` |
| Working on one feature | [feature/](feature/) — pick the feature, read its `README.md` first |
| Touching persistence, sync, or crypto | [blueprint/local-storage-architecture.md](blueprint/local-storage-architecture.md) + [blueprint/sync-architecture.md](blueprint/sync-architecture.md) + [skills/security.md](skills/security.md), in full |
| Asking "why is it built this way?" | [adr/](adr/) |
| Shipping a build | [release/](release/) |

## The six directories

```
docs/
├── skills/       HOW to build — reusable engineering knowledge, not app-specific
├── blueprint/    WHAT exists — this app's system architecture and roadmaps
├── feature/      HOW ONE FEATURE works — per-feature implementation reference
├── requirement/  WHAT the app must do — business/functional requirements
├── adr/          WHY — architecture decision records
└── release/      HOW IT SHIPS — build, environment, CI/CD, distribution
```

Each directory has a `README.md` that indexes and scopes it. One subject has one
home: if two documents seem to cover the same ground, the more specific one is
authoritative and the other must link to it rather than restate it.

---

## Authority precedence

When two documents disagree, the higher row wins:

| # | Source | Scope |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | [skills/engineering-standard.md](skills/engineering-standard.md) | Master engineering rules |
| 2 | [adr/](adr/) | Locked technical decisions |
| 3 | [skills/ai-engineering-playbook.md](skills/ai-engineering-playbook.md) | Operational checklists |
| 4 | `blueprint/*` | Target system architecture |
| 5 | `feature/*` | Per-feature implementation reference |
| 6 | `.claude/CLAUDE.md` | Session pointer for AI agents |

**The source code overrides all of them for what the app *currently does*.**
These documents describe intent and target state; where they diverge from `lib/`,
the divergence is a finding to report, not a licence to rewrite either side.
Known divergences are listed in [blueprint/README.md](blueprint/README.md#known-documentation--code-divergences).

---

## Conventions

- **File names**: lowercase `kebab-case.md`. Never `final.md`, `new.md`, `v2.md`.
- **ADRs**: `ADR-000N-short-decision-name.md`, never renumbered once accepted.
- **Feature directory names** match the `lib/features/` folder they document,
  hyphenated: `lib/features/my_visits` → `docs/feature/my-visits/`.
- **Every feature directory has a `README.md`** as its entry point.
- **Cross-references** are relative markdown links. Backticked paths are
  repo-relative (`docs/skills/security.md`), so they stay valid when quoted.
- **`⧉ backend repo`** marks a document that lives in the ISI API repository,
  not here. Those are not broken links; they are deliberately not vendored.
- **No secrets, tokens, keys, or certificates** appear anywhere in `docs/`.

No `requirement/` documents exist yet for any feature — see
[requirement/README.md](requirement/README.md) for what that costs and where
business rules currently live instead.
