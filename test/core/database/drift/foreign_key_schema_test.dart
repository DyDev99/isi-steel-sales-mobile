/// Guards the foreign keys the schema *deliberately keeps* — and, just as
/// importantly, the ones it deliberately removed.
///
/// ## Two separate hazards, one test file
///
/// **Hazard 1 — codegen silently drops constraints.** `drift_dev 2.31.0` +
/// `analyzer 10.2.0` emit **no** foreign keys from `references()`: the
/// reference resolves to nothing, no constraint is written, and no warning is
/// printed (`docs/blueprint/web-architecture.md` §8). Every constraint vanished on the next
/// `build_runner` run and the only symptom was a few behavioural tests a reader
/// in a hurry could dismiss as flaky. The survivors are therefore declared via
/// `customConstraints`, and the counts below are what stops that workaround
/// being removed without anyone noticing.
///
/// **Hazard 2 — constraints creeping back onto mirror tables.** ADR-011 removed
/// the foreign keys on tables that mirror backend state, because the backend
/// enforces those relationships before the row is ever sent and re-enforcing
/// them on-device destroyed data instead of protecting it. Re-adding one would
/// silently restore that data loss, so the absences are asserted explicitly.
///
/// ## Why it asserts on the live schema
///
/// Not on the table sources — they were correct the entire time; it was codegen
/// that dropped them. Not on `app_database.g.dart` either: because
/// `customConstraints` is an override on the *source* table class, the
/// generated `$…Table` subclass inherits it and the string never appears in
/// generated output. `sqlite_master` is the only place the truth is visible.
