/// Pins the wiring that makes `context.localized(...)` actually see Khmer.
///
/// ## The bug this exists to prevent
///
/// `MaterialApp` does not take `locale:` at face value — it *resolves* it
/// against `supportedLocales`, which defaults to `[Locale('en','US')]` when the
/// app never declares one. Passing `Locale('km')` to an app with no
/// `supportedLocales` therefore yields `Localizations.localeOf(context) == en`.
///
/// That is silent and it splits the app in two:
///
///  * `'key'.tr` keeps working — the String extension reads a global singleton
///    and never consults `Localizations`. All UI chrome turns Khmer.
///  * `context.localized(entity.displayName)` returns **English** — it asks
///    `Localizations.localeOf`, which is still saying `en`.
///
/// The result reads as "the Khmer master data isn't coming through", sending
/// you to hunt through generators, assets and sync paths — when the actual
/// cause is three missing lines on `MaterialApp`. Nothing throws, nothing logs,
/// and it is invisible to anyone testing in English.
