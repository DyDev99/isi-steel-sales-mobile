/// Simulator detection, pinned against **real paths** taken from a booted
/// simulator (`xcrun simctl get_app_container`) and a physical device bundle.
///
/// ## The bug this exists to prevent recurring
///
/// The first implementation checked only `SIMULATOR_DEVICE_NAME`. Those
/// variables are set for processes launched *through* `simctl` — which is why
/// `xcrun simctl spawn booted /usr/bin/env` shows them — but a Flutter app is
/// launched by the simulator's SpringBoard and inherits none of them.
///
/// The result: detection returned false on the Simulator, the factory handed
/// out the real camera, and iOS answered with its own "Camera not available"
/// alert. The whole mock system was inert exactly where it was needed.
///
/// The filesystem is the signal that survives however the process was
/// launched, so these tests pin the path shapes rather than the environment.
