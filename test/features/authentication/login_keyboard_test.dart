/// `LoginScreen` keeps `resizeToAvoidBottomInset: false` so the full-bleed
/// building photo is never squashed, which means the Scaffold does *not*
/// shorten the body when the keyboard opens — the content layer applies the
/// keyboard inset itself.
///
/// That is easy to undo by accident: delete the padding and the screen still
/// builds and still passes a smoke test, but the password field and Sign In
/// button sit underneath the keyboard, and the framework's scroll-into-view
/// stops working because the viewport still appears to reach the screen bottom.
/// These tests pin the observable consequence rather than the implementation,
/// so a different correct fix would still pass.
///
/// **On sizes:** `flutter_test` substitutes a font whose every glyph is a full
/// em square, so text measures far wider here than on a device — the two short
/// strings in `VersionFooter` come to ~377px against ~196px in reality. The
/// keyboard-closed case therefore runs on a wider surface, where that inflated
/// text still fits and a no-overflow assertion means something. It is a harness
/// artifact, not a layout bug.
