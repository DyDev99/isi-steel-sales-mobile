/// points open the builder for a shop the rep has already chosen — the
/// depot card's "create quotation", the checked-in visit flow, the
/// Continue-Working resume — and hold the depot's id without having loaded
/// the whole [Depot]. They passed it as `leadId`, the only slot that
/// existed, so anything reading `depot?.id` saw null and served a rep
/// standing in a known shop as though it were a walk-in: no price on any card
/// and no promotion, with the id sitting in the arguments the whole time.
