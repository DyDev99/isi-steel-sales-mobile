      // window multiplies every padding, radius, and font size by ~4.9.

      //     behaves exactly as before, so phone rendering is bit-identical.
      //   • wider          → the real viewport, which makes the scale factor
      //     1.0. `16.w` then means 16 logical pixels, and the layout is driven
      //     by breakpoints and constraints instead of a multiplier.
