/// Centralised access to device insets — safe area, keyboard, gesture bar,
/// home indicator — so features never reach into [MediaQuery] themselves.
///
/// ## Scope: deliberately small
///
/// This is **not** a general device/responsive abstraction, and that is a
/// decision rather than an omission:
///
/// - **Responsive sizing already has an owner.** `flutter_screenutil` is
///   configured in `app.dart` (`designSize: 390×844`) and used across the app.
///   A second breakpoint/responsive system here would compete with it, and
///   features would have to know which one to trust.
/// - **Safe area already has an owner.** `SafeArea` is used correctly in ~43
///   files. Wrapping it in a helper would add indirection without removing
///   anything — the only two places that read `padding.bottom` directly are
///   `app_coach`'s overlay and floating button, which position themselves
///   *outside* the tree's SafeArea and therefore legitimately need the raw
///   value. [safeBottom] serves exactly those cases.
///
/// What was genuinely duplicated was the keyboard inset in bottom sheets
/// (14 identical copies of `EdgeInsets.only(bottom: viewInsets.bottom)`), which
/// [AppBottomSheet] now owns via [sheetBottomInset].
///
/// ## Why an extension, not a static class
///
/// `context.deviceInsets` reads at the call site and, crucially, each getter
/// uses the scoped `MediaQuery.xOf(context)` accessors — so a widget reading
/// only [keyboard] does not rebuild when the screen *size* changes. A static
/// `DeviceHelper.of(context)` calling `MediaQuery.of(context)` would subscribe
/// every caller to every metric, which is the usual reason these helpers make
/// rebuild storms worse rather than better.
