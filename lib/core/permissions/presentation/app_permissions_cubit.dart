/// Drives the one dialog that primes **both** OS permissions this app needs, and

/// ## Why one dialog for two permissions
///
/// The app needs notifications (a route assignment has to reach the rep) and
/// foreground location (a customer's coordinates, and check-in verification).
/// Both were previously requested cold — push from the inbox card, location from
/// inside the customer form when the rep tapped "Save GPS". Two unexplained
/// system prompts at two unrelated moments is the worst possible framing, and on
/// iOS each one is close to a single chance.
///
/// So they are asked together, once, at a moment the rep can evaluate, with the
/// reason for each stated before the OS dialog appears. That is
/// `docs/feature/notification/README.md` §14's priming rule applied
/// to both permissions rather than only to push.
///
/// ## Why it lives in `core/` and not in a feature
///
/// Notifications belong to `features/notification`; location is used by
/// `features/order` and `features/my_visits`. A dialog covering both cannot live
/// in any one of them without that feature importing another's internals, which
/// `docs/skills/ai-engineering-playbook.md` §12 forbids. Both dependencies here
/// are already `core/` platform abstractions, so this composes them without
/// depending on a feature at all.
///
/// Push **registration** is a notification-feature concern, so it arrives as an
/// injected callback rather than a repository — the same seam the inbox cubit
/// uses for an action's `api_call`.
///
/// ## What it deliberately does not ask for
///
/// Background location. `GeolocatorTrackingService` escalates to "always"
/// immediately before it starts a route trace, which is both the iOS guideline
/// and the existing behaviour. Asking for background up front is how an app gets
/// refused foreground too.
