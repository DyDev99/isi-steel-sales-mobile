/// Constrains content to a readable measure and centres it on wide windows.
///
/// On [WindowSize.compact] this is a **pass-through** — it returns [child]
/// untouched, adding no widget to the tree. That is deliberate and is what lets
/// it be applied broadly without any risk to the mobile layout: on a phone it
/// is not merely visually neutral, it is structurally absent, so it cannot
/// affect intrinsic sizing, scroll behaviour, or golden output.
///
/// On wider windows it clamps to [Breakpoints.contentMaxWidth]. Without this,
/// a form field or list row on a 2560px monitor spans the whole screen, which
/// is hard to read (the eye loses its place tracking across a long row) and
/// hard to click accurately. Clamping is most of what separates a desktop
/// layout that feels designed from one that is merely stretched.
