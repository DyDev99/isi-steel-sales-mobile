/// Logs every API call — method, path, status, duration and error code — so an
/// integration problem is visible in the console without a proxy or a debugger.
///
/// Records surface via `dart:developer`, so they appear in the `flutter run`
/// console and in the DevTools log view, tagged `isi.debug` / `isi.error`.
///
/// ## What is deliberately *not* logged
///
/// `docs/skills/security.md` §10 is a hard constraint, not a preference: passwords,
/// tokens, e-mail addresses, phone numbers, customer names and money never go
/// to a log sink. Logs outlive the session that produced them — they are read
/// by other people, pulled into bug reports, and on Android any app holding
/// `READ_LOGS` can read them.
///
/// The login request is the sharp end of this. Its body is
/// `{employeeId, password, device}`; printing it verbatim, which is the
/// obvious way to "debug login", writes a working credential to the console.
/// Every field logged here goes through [LogRedactor] instead, which redacts
/// by key name *and* by value shape, so a JWT or an address that arrives under
/// an innocuous key is still caught.
///
/// ## When you need the actual payload
///
/// Sometimes you genuinely need to see what the server sent. That is off by
/// default and opt-in per run:
///
/// ```
/// flutter run --dart-define=API_LOG_BODIES=true
/// ```
///
/// Bodies are still redacted before printing, and the flag is ignored entirely
/// in release builds. Keep it to your own machine — it is a debugging aid, not
/// something to leave on in a shared build.
