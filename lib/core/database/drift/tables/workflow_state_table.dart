/// The resumable-workflow pointer, ported from the plaintext `routes.db`
/// (**T1.5b**).
///
/// This was the *last* live table in `routes.db` — the T1.5 purge emptied every
/// business table but could not delete the file while this one remained. With
/// this port the legacy file has no remaining readers and can finally be
/// removed.
///
/// ## Scope: this is a port, not ADR-007
///
/// ADR-007 specifies a generalized `WorkflowSession` in `core/workflow/` with
/// identity, expiry, and version fields. **This table is not that.** It is the
/// existing `my_visits`-scoped `ActiveWorkflow` shape moved verbatim into the
/// encrypted database so the plaintext file can go away. Adding the ADR-007
/// fields here would be building a module ahead of its plan
/// (`ENGINEERING_STANDARD.md` §2) and would change a row contract that
/// `ActiveWorkflowModel.fromRow`/`toRow` depend on.
///
/// The table lives in `core/database/drift/tables/` rather than under the
/// feature because every table in the single database does (ADR-001/ADR-004);
/// that placement is not an assertion that generalization has happened.
