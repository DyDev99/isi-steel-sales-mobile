/// |---|---|
/// | `id` | TEXT/UUID primary key, **client-generated** so offline creates need no server round-trip (§3) |
/// | `updated_at` | Last local mutation; drives delta pulls and LWW comparison |
/// | `deleted` | Soft delete — a row is never hard-deleted while its deletion still needs to reach SAP |
/// | `sync_state` | `synced` / `dirty` / `syncing` / `conflict` (`docs/SYNC_ENGINE.md` §5) |
/// | `server_revision` | Last known server version/ETag, for conflict detection |
/// | `dirty` | Convenience flag: a local write not yet confirmed synced |
