/// The Cambodian administrative gazetteer — province → district →
/// commune/sangkat → village — plus the commune-level postal code
/// (`docs/features/geo-location/README.md`).
///
/// ## Why this is a table and not an API cache
///
/// There is no geographic endpoint. `GET /mobile/customers/references` serves
/// exactly ten SAP `CustHelper` catalogues (`docs/features/create_BP/
/// customer-mobile-registration/sap-helpers.md`) and none of them is
/// geographic, so there is nothing to cache. Before this table the app carried
/// five provinces and one province's districts as `const` maps in
/// `bp_customer_form_data.dart`, which meant a rep in Kampot could not enter
/// their own district.
///
/// The data is therefore **bundled** as `assets/geo/kh_geo_seed_v1.json` and
/// imported here on first run. That is what makes the selector work on a
/// handset that has never had signal — the offline-first requirement in
/// ADR-002 applies to reference data a form cannot be completed without.
///
/// ## Why it lives in the encrypted database
///
/// Not because a village name is a secret — it is public record. Because the
/// address a rep selects becomes part of a customer record, and joining it out
/// of a plaintext side-store would put half of a PII row outside the
/// encryption boundary (`docs/SECURITY.md` §3). One database also means the
/// address can be resolved in the same transaction as the customer write.
///
/// ## No foreign keys (ADR-011)
///
/// `provinceCode`, `districtCode` and `communeCode` are plain indexed columns.
/// The hierarchy is validated in the domain layer
/// (`GeoAddress.validateHierarchy`) where a violation can be reported, rather
/// than by a constraint that aborts a write. A re-seed replaces rows level by
/// level; declaring the parent links would make the order of those four
/// statements load-bearing for no benefit the domain check does not give.

/// A province or the capital (25 rows).
