/// The notification inbox, mirrored into the single encrypted database
/// (`docs/features/notification-mobile.md` §1, ADR-001).
///
/// ## Why the inbox is stored at all
///
/// §1: *"The inbox is the notification. Push is only an accelerator."* Every
/// notification is written server-side before anything reaches Firebase, and a
/// push routinely never arrives — a flat battery, a coverage hole, an OEM
/// battery optimiser, a rotated token, or a P4 that is never pushed at all. So
/// the device keeps its own copy and reconciles it with
/// `GET /mobile/notifications`. A rep in a warehouse scrolls the same list they
/// had before they lost signal.
///
/// ## Encrypted, not cached
///
/// A notification body names a customer and a route. That is PII, so it belongs
/// in the encrypted Drift database and not in Hive
/// (`docs/skills/SECURITY.md` §3, `docs/blueprints/ARCHITECTURE.md` §3). The FCM payload is
/// deliberately thinner for the same reason (§9.2) — no prices, no credit
/// limits, no phone numbers — because a push renders on a locked screen in front
/// of whoever is holding the phone.
///
/// ## No foreign keys (ADR-011)
///
/// [Notifications.id] and the queue's `notification_id` are plain columns.
/// These tables mirror what the backend sent, and the backend enforced its own
/// relationships before transmitting. Re-declaring them on-device is what turned
/// ordinary conditions into data loss elsewhere in this schema: a push can land
/// before its catch-up page, so a queue row can legitimately reference a
/// notification this device has not stored yet, and aborting that write would
/// lose the rep's acknowledgement rather than harmlessly orphaning a row.

/// One inbox item — the local mirror of the §5 notification object.
///
/// Read patterns are (a) newest-first within a state set, and (b) outstanding
/// actions pinned to the top, so the indexes cover `created_at` and the
/// `(state, requires_ack)` pair the inbox query filters on.
