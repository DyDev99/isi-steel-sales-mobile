/// Forces one full re-sync of SAP-controlled master data so existing installs
/// pick up the Khmer half of every record.
///
/// ## Why this is needed at all
///
/// Making the feed bilingual is not enough. A device that has already synced
/// holds English-only rows *and* a `last_synced_at` watermark, and both sync
/// repositories only take the initial path when that watermark is `null`:
///
/// ```dart
/// final since = await _local.getLastSyncedAt(entity);
/// if (since == null) return runInitialSync();   // ← never true again
/// ```
///
/// Every subsequent sync is therefore a *delta*, which by definition only
/// carries rows the backend says changed. Nothing tells it that 11,000
/// unchanged rows just grew a Khmer name. The rep updates the app, sees the UI
/// chrome switch to Khmer, and every product/customer/shop name stays Latin —
/// which reads as "localization is broken" when the localization is fine and
/// the *local cache* is stale.
///
/// Clearing the watermark is the established remedy in this codebase: schema
/// migration v9 does exactly the same thing (`DELETE FROM catalog_sync_meta`)
/// for the same reason, with the same comment. This is that fix generalised to
/// all three master-data domains and detached from a schema bump, because the
/// tables did not change this time — only their *contents* did.
///
/// ## Why a marker instead of a schema version
///
/// There is no schema change to hang a migration off. A one-shot marker in
/// `app_metadata` gives the same run-exactly-once guarantee without a
/// gratuitous version bump and the `build_runner` churn that comes with it.
///
/// ## Safety
///
/// This only resets **cursors**, never rows. All three domains are
/// SAP-controlled and overwritten wholesale on sync (see `customers_table.dart`
/// — "reps have no write path to these columns"), so the worst case is one
/// larger-than-usual sync on the next launch. No rep-captured data — visits,
/// photos, quotations, the sync queue — is touched, and nothing is deleted.
///
/// It is also safe when it runs *before* the first sync (a fresh install):
/// clearing an already-empty cursor table is a no-op, the marker is written,
/// and the initial sync proceeds normally.
