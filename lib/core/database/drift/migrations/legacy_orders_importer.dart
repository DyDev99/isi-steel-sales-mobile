/// Imports the legacy plaintext `catalog.db` into the single encrypted database

///
/// ## Why this exists at all
///
/// T1.5b moves quotations, sales orders, and the sync queue onto Drift tables.
/// Without an importer, that cutover would be silent data loss for every device
/// upgrading from a pre-T1.5b build: the app would open the new empty tables
/// and a rep's saved quotations — including work queued offline and not yet
/// pushed to SAP — would simply be gone, with the only copy sitting in a
/// plaintext file nothing reads any more.
///
/// The sync queue is the sharpest case. Its rows are, by definition, work the
/// server has never seen. Losing them is unrecoverable in a way losing a cached
/// catalog is not.
///
/// ## Design
///
/// Mirrors [LegacyRoutesImporter] deliberately, so the two read the same and a
/// reader who understands one understands the other:
///
/// - **Idempotent** — upserts keyed by the legacy primary key, plus a
///   completion marker in `app_metadata` that short-circuits re-runs.
/// - **One transaction** — the whole import lands or none of it does.
/// - **Never purges on its own** — [LegacyImportResult.safeToPurge] is advice;
///   deleting the plaintext source stays the caller's explicit decision.
///
/// It is simpler than the routes importer in one respect: these three tables
/// are self-contained, with no cross-database foreign key to reconcile, so
/// there are no orphan rows to skip. `skipped` is therefore always empty, and
/// `safeToPurge` reduces to "a real import ran and completed".
