/// Prepares the application before any feature loads.
///
/// ## Two rules this service exists to enforce
///
/// **1. Boot never blocks on the network** (ADR-002 §3, `docs/OFFLINE_FIRST.md`
/// §2.6). A signed-in rep standing in a warehouse with no signal must reach
/// their data. Therefore this service performs **no** token validation, **no**
/// token refresh, and **no** master-data download. Token refresh is lazy — the
/// network interceptor does it on the first real request, or the sync
/// coordinator does it opportunistically once [ConnectivityService] reports
/// reachable. A failed refresh **never** logs the user out; only a definitive
/// server rejection (refresh token revoked) does, and that cannot be known
/// offline.
///
/// **2. Bootstrap never navigates** (`docs/OFFLINE_FIRST.md` §2.2, ADR-002 §5).
/// Each surface owns its own transition; `SplashScreen` decides
/// `main` vs `chooseLanguage` from `onboarding_complete`. A central
/// bootstrap-driven redirect is the exact global-listener pattern that was
/// already tried, caused guest redirect loops, and was reverted — it is listed
/// as an anti-pattern in `docs/AI_ENGINEERING_PLAYBOOK.md` §12.
///
/// Auth resolution itself stays where it already works: `AuthBloc`
/// (`AuthCheckRequested`) resolves the cached session in the background and
/// mirrors it into `SessionManager` (`docs/OFFLINE_FIRST.md` §2.1/§2.3). This
/// service does not duplicate that.
///
/// ## Ordering note
///
/// The encrypted `AppDatabase` is registered inside [initDependencies] as a lazy
/// singleton and opens on first use, so "init DI" *is* "init the database" —
/// they are not separate ordered steps. Hive must be opened **before** DI
/// because `AppPreferences` resolves `HiveService.cacheBox`.
class AppBootstrapService {
  const AppBootstrapService();

  /// Runs the boot sequence. Safe to await before `runApp`; performs no I/O
  /// that can hang on a dead network.

    // resolved from DI because it must be able to report a DI failure.
    const AppLogger logger = ConsoleAppLogger();

    // The host is the single most useful thing to see first: almost every
    // "the app cannot log in" report ends with the build pointing somewhere
    // unexpected. `hostOverridden` distinguishes a `--dart-define` launch from
    // the compiled `.env`, which is otherwise invisible.

      //    ADR-002 §3 holds. On web both are no-ops: `AbsentLegacySource`

      //     arms happens later, opportunistically, on whatever screen asks.
      await _backfillMasterDataLocale(logger);

      // 6. Session restore: intentionally a no-op here. AuthBloc's
      //    AuthCheckRequested reads the cached user from secure storage in the
      //    background with zero network calls (OFFLINE_FIRST §2.1, §2.5).

      // 7. Connectivity. Started last so a slow reachability probe can never
      //    delay first frame; the initial state is `offline` until the probe
      //    proves otherwise.
      //
      //    Deliberately **not** awaited. `start()` awaits its first probe — a
      //    contract its own tests rely on — so awaiting it here put a network
      //    round trip on the path to `runApp`. Against an unreachable gateway
      //    that stalled boot for the probe timeout, and before that timeout
      //    was enforced (the probe had no `connectTimeout`, see
      //    [HttpReachabilityProbe]) it stalled indefinitely: no first frame,
      //    just the launch screen. That is precisely the "boot never blocks on
      //    the network" rule in this class's doc comment, ADR-002 §3 and
      //    OFFLINE_FIRST §2.6.
      //
      //    Fire-and-forget is safe because nothing here reads the result:
      //    `ConnectivityService` publishes to a broadcast stream and every
      //    consumer is already built to react to a transition rather than to
      //    poll an initial value.

//
//   • Sync-queue crash recovery (inFlight → queued) — `docs/SYNC_ENGINE.md` §7.
//     Blocked on: a Drift `sync_queue` table + `SyncQueueDao` (Phase 2), and
//     promoting the Orders feature's working queue into `core/sync/` (ADR-006).
//
//   • SyncCoordinator start — `docs/SYNC_ENGINE.md` §9. Blocked on the above.
//
//   • WorkflowSession resume check — `docs/OFFLINE_FIRST.md` §3, ADR-007.
//     Blocked on: a Drift `workflow_session` table + generalizing `my_visits`'
//     `ActiveWorkflow` into `core/workflow/` (Phase 3). NOTE: `workflow_state`
//     is the last live table in the plaintext `routes.db` — the T1.5 purge
//     empties every business table but cannot delete the file until this lands.
//
//   • User-workspace init/reset on user switch. Blocked on an ADR: no business
//     table carries a `userId` today, and ADR-001 mandates a single database,
//     so per-user isolation is an open architectural decision.
//
// See `docs/MIGRATION_PLAN.md` for sequencing. Do not stub these in with
// no-op implementations — an empty hook reads as "done" to the next engineer.
