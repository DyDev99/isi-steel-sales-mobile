/// The one place that knows how a bilingual master-data field is spelled on
/// the wire and in a database row.
///
/// Three naming conventions are already in the codebase and all three are
/// load-bearing, so none of them can simply be renamed away:
///
///  * `name` / `nameKh` — the catalog feed and `products` table, matching SAP's
///    `MaterialDes` / `MaterialDesKH` pair;
///  * `enName` / `khName` — the customer master, matching SAP's BP `name1` /
///    `name3`;
///  * `name` / `name_kh` — Drift rows, which are snake_case.
///
/// Without a shared codec each model re-implements the same null/empty/fallback
/// handling, and they drift: one treats `''` as "no Khmer" and falls back,
/// another renders a blank label. That difference is invisible in English and
/// only shows up as an empty row after a rep switches to Khmer — the exact
/// class of bug this file exists to make impossible.
///
/// Deliberately free of Flutter and of the active locale: this is *parsing*,
/// not rendering. Rendering is [LocalizedTextContext.localized] (with a
/// `BuildContext`) or [ActiveLanguage] (without one).
