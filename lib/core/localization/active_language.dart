/// Rendering master data normally goes through

/// [Localizations] and is what makes a language switch a plain rebuild. But
/// some code that must be language-aware has no context and never will:
///
///  * **search and sort** run in a cubit or a repository — a rep sorting the
///    customer directory alphabetically in Khmer expects Khmer collation order,
///    and that decision happens before any widget exists;
///  * **background surfaces** (the route-tracking foreground notification,
///    generated PDFs) render outside the widget tree entirely.
///
/// Those call sites used to either hardcode English or thread a locale
/// parameter through three layers. Both are worse than reading the one value
/// the app already keeps globally: [LocalizationService] is a singleton
/// precisely so `'key'.tr` can work anywhere, and this exposes the same fact
/// for master data.
///
/// **Do not use this inside `build()`.** It is a plain read with no dependency
/// registered, so a widget resolving through it will not rebuild when the
/// language changes — use `context.localized(...)` there, which will.
