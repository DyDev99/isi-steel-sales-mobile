/// Mixin for anything that loads data from a protected endpoint.
///
/// Authentication is a platform capability, not a per-feature one. Before this
/// existed, each cubit that wanted to be careful wrote its own
/// `if (!session.isAuthenticated) return;` — and the ones that forgot fired a
/// request during boot that could only be rejected. The customer directory did
/// exactly that: it ran a full initial sync on every cold start *before*
/// sign-in, producing one guaranteed failure per launch and an error banner in
/// front of a user who had done nothing wrong.
///
/// Usage:
///
/// ```dart
/// class CustomerSyncCubit extends Cubit<CustomerSyncState>
///     with ProtectedFeature {
///   @override
///   final SessionManager session;
///
///   Future<void> load() => whenAuthenticated(() async {
///         // only runs with a live session
///       });
/// }
/// ```
///
/// A feature author never writes `checkToken`, `getToken`, `refreshToken`,
/// `handle401` or `redirectLogin` — the interceptor and [SessionManager] own
/// all of that. The only decision left here is *whether to ask at all*.
mixin ProtectedFeature {
  /// The global session. Inject it; do not resolve it from the locator inside
  /// the mixin, or the feature becomes untestable without a container.
  SessionManager get session;

  /// The grant this feature's endpoints require, e.g. `customers.read`.
  ///
  /// Override it and [canLoad] additionally checks the signed-in user holds it.
  /// Null means "any authenticated user".
  ///
  /// This is what the customers guide means by *"read the caller's permissions
  /// from `GET /auth/me` and hide actions they lack"*. It is a usability
  /// measure, never a security control — the server re-checks every one. Its
  /// job is to stop the app firing a request that can only come back 403, as
  /// the customer sync did twice per launch for a rep whose role granted
  /// `outlets.*` but not `customers.*`.
  /// Empty means "any authenticated user". Multiple entries are **any-of**,
  /// not all-of: the same capability is spelled `customers.read` on one
  /// deployment and `outlets.read` on another, and a feature needs either.
