/// The stand-in camera: bundled test images, returned as real files.

/// ## Why this exists
///
/// The iOS Simulator has no camera. `image_picker` opens and returns nothing,
/// so every flow that needs a photograph — customer evidence, visit proof,
/// drawing upload, visual search — is untestable there. This returns a real
/// image through the same type, so those flows run unchanged.
///
/// ## Why it writes a file
///
/// Callers do `File(result.path)`, read bytes off it, copy it, post it as
/// multipart. Handing back an in-memory object would force each of them to
/// learn where the image came from, which is the coupling this whole seam
/// exists to remove. The bytes are written through
/// [persistCapturedBytes], the same store the real capture paths already use,
/// so mobile gets a filesystem path and web gets a blob URL.
