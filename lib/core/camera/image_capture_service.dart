/// ## Why this returns [XFile]
///
/// Because everything downstream already speaks it — the proof-photo stamper
/// reads bytes off it, the drawing upload copies its path, the customer
/// evidence upload posts it as a multipart file. Returning anything else would
/// force every one of those flows to branch on where the image came from,
/// which is exactly what this exists to prevent.
///
/// A mock image is written to a real file before it is returned, so a caller
/// doing `File(result.path)` cannot tell the difference.
///
/// ## What this is not
///
/// Not a replacement for [ProofPhotoService], [ImageSearchService] or the
/// customer evidence upload. Those own the *business* logic — stamping,
/// matching, compression, validation, upload — and keep it whether the pixels
/// came from a lens or an asset. This replaces only the acquisition step.
