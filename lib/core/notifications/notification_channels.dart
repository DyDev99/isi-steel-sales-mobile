/// The Android notification channels this app owns
/// (`docs/features/notification-mobile.md` §9.3).
///
/// ## Why these must exist before the first push
///
/// The backend stamps `android.notification.channel_id` on every push. Android
/// will not create a channel on demand — a push naming one that does not exist
/// is dropped into a default channel the rep cannot see or control, so their
/// per-category OS settings silently stop working and a mis-tagged P1 arrives
/// with no sound. Channels are therefore created at startup, before any message
/// can arrive, by `NotificationChannelRegistrar`.
///
/// A channel's importance is also **immutable after creation**: Android ignores
/// any later change so a user's own adjustment can never be overridden by an
/// app update. Correcting one in a future release needs a new channel id, not a
/// new importance value here.
///
/// ## Why this lives in `core/` keyed by a raw string
///
/// The channel table has to exist at boot, before any feature is resolved, and
/// `core/` must not import a feature (`docs/blueprints/ARCHITECTURE.md` §2). So the key is
/// the wire category code (`ASSIGNMENT`) rather than the notification feature's
/// enum, and the feature maps its enum onto it.
