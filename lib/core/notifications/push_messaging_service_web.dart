/// The web transport: there isn't one, and that is a decision rather than a gap.
///
/// ## Why web has no push in this build
///
/// FCM on the web is a different delivery mechanism from the mobile one, not the
/// same one with a different plugin. It needs three things this app does not
/// ship: a `firebase-messaging-sw.js` service worker at the site root, a VAPID
/// key pair registered against the Firebase project, and the Firebase web config
/// inlined into `web/index.html`. Half-wiring it produces the worst possible
/// outcome — a browser that *asks* for notification permission and then never
/// delivers anything.
///
/// It also buys very little. The web target is a desk-bound view of the same
/// data (ADR-010), where a rep already has the app open; the mobile handset in
/// the field is the surface that needs waking.
///
/// ## Why this is a no-op and not an error
///
/// `docs/feature/notification/README.md` §1: *"Design the app so that a
/// dropped push costs nothing."* Web is the permanent case of that. Every method
/// answers honestly — [isSupported] is false, [authorization] is
/// [PushAuthorization.unsupported], [token] is null — so
/// `PushDeviceRepository` skips registration entirely rather than posting a
/// registration with an empty token, and the inbox catch-up runs exactly as it
/// does on a handset.
///
/// This is why nothing above `PushMessagingService` needs a `kIsWeb` branch.
