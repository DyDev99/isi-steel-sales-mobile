/// **1. Channel registration.** `docs/features/notification-mobile.md` §9.3
/// requires all ten channels to exist *before* the first push, because Android
/// drops a push naming an unknown channel into a default the rep cannot see or
/// control. This has to happen at startup and cannot be fetched.
///
/// **2. Local alerts.** Three cases need an alert the OS did not produce:
///
///  * a push arriving in the foreground, where §10 wants the OS banner
///    suppressed and something in-app instead — this is the fallback for when
///    the app is foregrounded but the relevant screen is not visible;
///  * the "somebody else already handled that" message the offline action queue
///    shows on a `409 Notification.AlreadyResolved`, which §8.5 requires be told
///    to the rep rather than silently discarded;
///  * anything raised while offline, which by definition never went near FCM.
///
/// Web has neither job — see `local_notification_presenter_web.dart`.
