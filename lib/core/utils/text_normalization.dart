///
/// ## Why this exists
///
/// SAP's Khmer master data carries **zero-width characters** as word-break
/// hints — `U+200B` (space), `U+200C` (non-joiner), `U+200D` (joiner). In the
/// current production extract, 1,130 of 5,990 Khmer names contain at least one
/// (`docs/feature/customer/mobile/search-customer.md` §Khmer search).
///
/// They are invisible on screen. A representative reads a shop's name off the
/// list, types it back, and a naive `LIKE` finds nothing:
///
/// ```text
/// stored    ដេប៉ូ<ZWSP><ZWSP><ZWSP> រស្មី សៀមរាប
/// typed     ដេប៉ូ រស្មី សៀមរាប
/// ```
///
/// The server strips these from both the term and the name columns before
/// comparing. **Local search has to do the same**, or the offline directory
/// answers differently from the online one — and answers wrongly for roughly a
/// fifth of Khmer names.
library;

/// The zero-width characters SAP embeds in Khmer text.
///
/// Deliberately only these three. Stripping a broader class (e.g. all `Cf`
/// format characters) would also remove the bidirectional marks that legitimately
/// change how a string renders.

  '\u200B', // ZERO WIDTH SPACE
  '\u200C', // ZERO WIDTH NON-JOINER
  '\u200D', // ZERO WIDTH JOINER

/// Removes SAP's zero-width word-break hints.
///
/// Apply to **both** sides of a comparison. Stripping only the stored value, or
/// only the typed term, leaves the mismatch in place.

///  * zero-width characters are removed, so Khmer text matches what SAP stored;
///  * phone-shaped input is reduced to digits and a leading `+`, because phone
///    numbers are normalised on write — `012 345 678` is stored as `012345678`,
///    so searching `012 345` would otherwise match nothing.
///
/// Khmer and Latin text is otherwise passed through verbatim. The server does
/// no case folding for Khmer (the script has no case), and inventing further
/// client-side cleverness would make the local and remote results diverge.
