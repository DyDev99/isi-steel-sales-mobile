/// `byName` throws `ArgumentError` on any string it does not recognise, and
/// almost every call site in this app feeds it a value that came from outside
/// the current build:
///
///  * **A Drift row written by an older version.** Renaming or removing an
///    enum value is a silent, delayed crash — the code compiles, the tests
///    pass on a fresh database, and then every existing installation throws on
///    the first read of its own data.
///  * **A server payload.** A newer backend can introduce a status this build
///    has never heard of, and the correct response is to degrade, not to take
///    the screen down.
///
/// Failing soft is right, but failing *silently* is not: a value that no
/// longer parses is a real defect and someone has to see it. So the fallback
/// path logs in debug builds and is quiet in release.
