/// A calendar that draws its month in, then marks the current day.
///
/// ## Why drawn rather than `Icons.calendar_today_rounded`
///
/// The glyph it replaces is a static outline: it names the card but says
/// nothing. Drawn, the same 36pt medallion can show a month *filling in* and a
/// day being marked — which is the card's subject. That satisfies FS-ANI-4
/// (motion explains something) rather than decorating for its own sake.
///
/// Nothing here is data-bound. The grid is a fixed twelve cells and the marker
/// always lands on the same one; it is an icon, not a chart. Binding it to a
/// real day count would make it a second, quieter progress indicator competing
/// with the bar and the percentage pill directly beneath it — and inventing a
/// figure to fill it would be exactly the fabricated-data trap FS-NN-5 names.
///
/// ## The motion is deliberately slow
///
/// Same reasoning as [WorkIcon], which this deliberately matches: a ~5s cycle
/// where the action occupies roughly the first two seconds and the rest is
/// stillness. This sits on the home screen permanently, beside three other
/// looping icons. Anything brisker turns a work surface into a fairground.
///
/// Honours `MediaQuery.disableAnimations` by holding the finished frame — the
/// drawing carries the meaning, only the movement is optional (FS-ANI-7).
