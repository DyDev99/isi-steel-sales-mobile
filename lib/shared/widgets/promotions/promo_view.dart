/// and its own doc is emphatic that it "is *not* a price… carries no amount and
/// no currency". These are the depot discount *schemes* of the Promotions BRD —
/// percentages and rebates against an invoice, each with a four-step approval
/// trail behind it. Two different objects that the business calls by the same
/// word; conflating them would put a rate where a quantity ladder belongs.
///

/// layer lands, that case should read from `PromotionRepository` rather than
/// carry its own numbers.

/// quotation screen shows alongside it (a depot's own pending request, and a
/// buy-X-get-Y goods promotion). Presentation-level on purpose: the real
/// entities land with the data layer, and building them now would jump ahead of
/// the migration plan (`.claude/CLAUDE.md` §1).
