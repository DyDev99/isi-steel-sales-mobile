/// field names. Each feature maps its own entity onto this; the layout only
/// ever sees strings.

/// limit, and a customer opened from the directory genuinely has no promotion
/// counts. Passing a placeholder string instead would invent data, which on a
/// screen a rep reads in front of the shop owner is worse than showing less.
