/// A scrollable form body that behaves correctly while the keyboard is open.
///
/// ## What this owns, and what it deliberately does not
///
/// Two things must be true for a focused field to stay visible: the scrollable
/// must be able to scroll, and its viewport must end above the keyboard.
///
/// This widget owns the **first**. The second already has an owner in every
/// context this app uses:
///
///  - **Screens** — `Scaffold` resizes for the keyboard by default
///    (`resizeToAvoidBottomInset`), which shortens the viewport for us.
///  - **Sheets** — [AppBottomSheet] applies `EdgeInsets.only(bottom: keyboard)`
///    around its child.
///
/// So this does **not** add a keyboard inset by default. Doing so would
/// double-count against those owners and leave a dead band the height of the
/// keyboard below the content — the classic symptom of two layers each "fixing"
/// the keyboard. Set [reserveKeyboardInset] only where neither owner applies,
/// i.e. a `Scaffold` that must keep `resizeToAvoidBottomInset: false` for a
/// full-bleed backdrop (the login screen is the one such case).
///
/// Once the viewport ends above the keyboard, Flutter's own
/// `EditableText` scroll-into-view brings the focused field into view without
/// any `FocusNode`/`ensureVisible` plumbing here. Hand-rolled `ensureVisible`
/// calls are what fight that built-in behaviour and cause the double-scroll
/// jump, so this deliberately adds none.
///
/// ## Why not a package
///
/// `MediaQuery.viewInsetsOf` plus a scroll view covers every case in this app,
/// so a keyboard-visibility dependency would add a plugin, a platform channel
/// and a stream subscription to re-derive a value the framework already
/// rebuilds us with.
