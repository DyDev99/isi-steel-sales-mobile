/// Strokes [rrect] as a dashed outline, without touching `PathMetrics`.
///
/// ## Why this exists
///
/// The obvious implementation is `path.computeMetrics()` and then
/// `metric.extractPath(a, b)` once per dash. On Android and iOS that is fine.
/// On **web** it blows the stack: Flutter's HTML/CanvasKit engine builds paths
/// lazily (`lib/_engine/engine/lazy_path.dart`), and extracting a sub-path from
/// a metric of a lazily-built path re-enters the builder, so a border with a
/// few dozen dashes recurses through
/// `builtPath → apply → builtPath → buildIterator → builtMetricAtIndex → …`
/// until it overflows. The failure is a wall of identical frames with no line
/// of app code in it, which is why it is worth never producing.
///
/// So the outline is flattened to a polyline once — straight edges plus sampled
/// corner arcs — and then walked arithmetically, emitting one `drawLine` per
/// dash. No `Path`, no metrics, nothing lazy, and it is cheaper besides.
///
/// [dash] and [gap] are in logical pixels along the perimeter. Corner arcs are
/// sampled at [arcSegments] segments per 90°, which is indistinguishable from a
/// true arc at the radii used in this app.
