/// ## What this class is for
///
/// `docs/feature/notification/README.md` §16 is a checklist of things that are
/// each individually easy to forget and individually invisible when missed:
/// channels created before the first push, `getInitialMessage()` checked at
/// startup, `onTokenRefresh` wired to registration, catch-up on start *and* on
/// foreground, the queue drained on reconnect. Every one of them fails silently —
/// the app looks healthy and a rep quietly stops receiving work.
///
/// So they live together, in one place, with one entry point. A reviewer can read
/// [start] against §16 line by line.
///
/// ## What it deliberately does not do
///
/// **It never navigates.** Deep links are resolved and published on
/// [destinations]; a widget that owns a `Navigator` listens and moves. A
/// non-widget class reaching for a global navigator key is the pattern
/// `docs/skills/AI_ENGINEERING_PLAYBOOK.md` §12 lists as an anti-pattern, and it is how
/// the app previously ended up with duplicate redirects and guests being yanked
/// between screens.
///
/// **It holds no state a screen needs.** Counts and lists come from the
/// repository's streams, which are fed by the local mirror, so a screen built
/// while this class was still starting up is not missing anything.
