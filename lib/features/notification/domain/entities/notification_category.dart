/// `GET /notifications/preferences`**, not from a list compiled into the app —
/// a category added server-side is invisible until the next release otherwise.
/// This enum exists for the two jobs that genuinely need a compile-time value:
///
///  * mapping a category onto its Android notification channel
///    (`NotificationChannels`), which has to exist before the first push
///    arrives and therefore cannot be fetched;
///  * choosing an icon and an accent colour in the inbox.
///
/// Both of those degrade gracefully through [unknown]. Anything that enumerates
/// categories *for the user* must read the API.
