/// One item in the rep's inbox — the notification itself, not a hint that one
/// exists (`docs/features/notification-mobile.md` §5).
///
/// ## The inbox is the system of record
///
/// Every notification is written to the backend's database *before* anything is
/// sent to Firebase, and a push routinely never arrives: a flat battery, a
/// coverage hole, a declined OS permission, an OEM battery optimiser, a rotated
/// FCM token, or simply a P4 that is never pushed at all. So this entity is
/// populated from `GET /mobile/notifications` and merely *accelerated* by
/// `onMessage`. A screen whose only source is the FCM callback shows a rep less
/// than half their work.
///
/// ## Field naming
///
/// The wire representation is `snake_case`, unlike the rest of the API, because
/// the notification object is quoted verbatim in the published specification and
/// in the FCM payload. That translation lives in `NotificationApiMapper`; this
/// entity is ordinary Dart and carries no wire concerns.
