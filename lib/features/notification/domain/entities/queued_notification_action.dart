/// A rep reads and acknowledges notifications in a warehouse with no signal for
/// hours. The local state change must be immediate — it is what they see — and
/// the server call has to survive until a connection returns. Dropping it means
/// the escalation chain fires against a rep who already did the work.
///
/// The queue is drained on reconnect, and the rules for each outcome are
/// specific (§8.5):
///
///  * **`204`** — done, remove the row.
///  * **`409 Notification.AlreadyResolved`** — somebody else decided first.
///    Remove the row and **tell the rep**; §13.6 requires a clear resolution
///    message, never a silent discard. Do not retry.
///  * **transient** — stop draining and keep the whole queue for the next
///    reconnect. Continuing past a network failure would spend the rest of the
///    queue against the same dead connection.
///  * **anything else permanent** — remove the row; replaying a request the
///    server rejects on its merits will never succeed.
///
/// Replaying an action the server already recorded answers `204`, so a queue
/// draining after reconnect never stalls on its own success.
