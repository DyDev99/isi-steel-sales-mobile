/// deregistering are opposite lifecycle events, and asking for the permission is
/// a third thing entirely, gated by a one-shot iOS prompt.

/// Registers or refreshes this installation.
///
/// §4.1 lists four callers, and all four are wired: after login, on every app
/// launch, from `onTokenRefresh`, and on a permission change. The endpoint is
/// idempotent on `deviceId`, so calling it too often costs one cheap round trip
/// — calling it too rarely is how a rep silently stops receiving anything.
