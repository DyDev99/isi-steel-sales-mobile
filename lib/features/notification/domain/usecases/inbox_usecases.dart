/// The inbox use cases.
///
/// ## Why several classes share one file
///
/// The house convention is one use case per file, and it earns its keep where a
/// use case carries logic worth reading on its own. These eleven do not: each is
/// a named, single-purpose entry point onto one repository, and the important
/// reading — why a read is local, why a write is queued, why a 409 is not
/// retried — lives in `NotificationInboxRepository` and its implementation
/// where it belongs. Eleven files averaging six lines would scatter the seam
/// without adding a single sentence anyone needs.
///
/// The rule that actually matters is intact and is the reason these are not
/// collapsed into fewer classes: **one use case per business action**, no
/// branching on a "mode" parameter. Marking read, recording an action and
/// dismissing are three different things to the server and to a supervisor's
/// escalation chain (`docs/features/notification-mobile.md` §8.3), so they are
/// three types.

/// The inbox slice matching a query, live.
///
/// A stream, not a future: three things mutate this list behind the screen's
/// back — a catch-up sync, an arriving push, and the action queue draining after
/// a reconnect.
