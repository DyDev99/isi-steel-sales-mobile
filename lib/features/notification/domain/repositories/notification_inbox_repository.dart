/// [watch] and [counts] answer from the device. `docs/feature/notification/README.md`
/// §1 establishes the inbox as the system of record and push as a mere

/// show a rep in a warehouse an empty screen and an error banner, which is
/// precisely what the offline-first design exists to prevent (ADR-002 §2).
///
/// ## Writes are local-first
///
/// Every mutation lands in the mirror and enqueues its server call **in the same
/// transaction** (ADR-006, `docs/skills/SYNC_ENGINE.md` §2). That is a correctness rule,
/// not a style choice: a state change that is visible to the rep but has no
/// queued call is a route the supervisor still thinks was never acknowledged.
