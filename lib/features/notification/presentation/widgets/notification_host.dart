/// Starts the notification machinery and turns its two output streams into
/// things a user can see: a navigation, and an in-app card.
///
/// ## Why this lives under `MaterialApp` rather than in the boot sequence
///
/// Two of `NotificationCoordinator.start()`'s steps need what boot does not yet
/// have:
///
///  * **Translated Android channel names.** The language bundle is loaded
///    asynchronously by `LanguageCubit` when the widget tree builds, so `.tr`
///    returns raw keys during `AppBootstrapService`. Android caches a channel's
///    name at creation and **ignores every later rename** — a deliberate
///    protection for the user's own settings — so creating the ten channels
///    before the bundle lands would pin every rep's system settings to strings
///    like `notifications.channel.assignment.name`, permanently.
///  * **A Navigator.** A tapped notification has to go somewhere.
///
/// [_ensureLanguageLoaded] closes the first gap explicitly rather than hoping a
/// frame or two is enough.
///
/// ## Why it navigates through `navigatorKey`
///
/// This widget sits in `MaterialApp.builder`, which wraps the Navigator rather
/// than sitting beneath it, so `Navigator.of(context)` would not find one. The
/// app already keeps a `navigatorKey` for exactly this class of need.
///
/// This is not the global-listener anti-pattern `docs/skills/AI_ENGINEERING_PLAYBOOK.md`
/// §12 warns about: that one is a session listener redirecting users who did not
/// ask to move. Here a rep tapped a notification. Navigation is the only correct
/// response, and doing it anywhere else would mean every screen re-implementing
/// the same routing table.
