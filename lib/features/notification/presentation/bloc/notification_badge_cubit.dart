/// The badge numbers, for the app bar bell and anything else that shows a count.
///
/// ## Two numbers, two meanings
///
/// `docs/feature/notification/README.md` §5.4 and §7 keep these apart on
/// purpose:
///
///  * **`unread`** drives the bell — "there is something to look at".
///  * **`actionRequired`** drives the app icon — "there is work you owe
///    somebody". A badge counting unread mail says *you have mail*; one counting
///    outstanding actions says *you have work*, and only the second earns an
///    interruption.
///
/// A **read** assignment is still outstanding, so the two numbers legitimately
/// disagree and neither is derivable from the other.
///
/// ## A singleton, not a per-screen factory
///
/// The bell lives in the app bar, which is rebuilt on every tab change, and the
/// inbox sheet shows the same figures. A factory registration would open a fresh
/// Drift stream per rebuild and leak one per discarded app bar; worse, the two
/// surfaces could briefly disagree, which is exactly how a badge stops being
/// believed.
