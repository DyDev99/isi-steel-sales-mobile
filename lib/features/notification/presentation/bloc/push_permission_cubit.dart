/// exactly one prompt, ever. Spending it on a rep who has just installed the app
/// and has no idea what it does is how an app ends up permanently silent — and
/// there is no recovery except talking every affected user through system
/// settings by hand.
///
/// So the prompt is gated behind an in-app explainer, shown only once the rep
/// has seen their first route and the sentence *"get notified the moment a
/// route, order, or approval needs you"* means something concrete to them.
///
/// ## What happens on a decline
///
/// Everything keeps working. The registration is posted with
/// `pushPermissionGranted: false` so the inbox still syncs and the delivery log
/// reads `NO_DEVICE` rather than a run of failures; the inbox shows an
/// unobtrusive banner linking to system settings; and the explainer may be
/// re-shown **at most once every 14 days**. That cap is [_reofferInterval], and
