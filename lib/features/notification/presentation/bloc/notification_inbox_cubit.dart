/// ## Reads come from a local stream, not from a fetch
///
/// [_subscribe] binds to the repository's Drift-backed stream, so a catch-up, an
/// arriving push and the action queue draining all land on the screen without
/// the screen asking. The network call ([refresh]) only *feeds* that stream —
/// it never populates the state directly. That is what makes the inbox render
/// instantly and identically offline, which
/// `docs/features/notification-mobile.md` §1 treats as the whole point.
///
/// ## Reading and acting are different gestures
///
/// [open] marks read; [runAction] records an action. §8.3 is blunt about why
/// they must not be merged: a route assignment that has been *read* still counts
/// against the badge and still escalates to a supervisor if it is never
/// *acknowledged*. Wiring "the rep scrolled past it" to the action call would
/// silently disarm that escalation for every assignment in the system.
