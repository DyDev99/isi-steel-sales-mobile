/// Stands in until the promotions data layer exists — the BRD's `promotion`,
/// `promotion_request` and `promotion_tier` tables (§7) have no Drift schema
/// yet, and building one now would jump ahead of the migration plan
/// (`.claude/CLAUDE.md` §1). Lives in its own file, not inside the widget, so
/// the screen has exactly one line to delete when the repository lands and so
/// this list cannot quietly ship as if it were content.
///
/// Dates are relative to [_today] rather than fixed calendar strings: the old
/// screen hardcoded '31 Aug 2026', which silently became a screen full of
/// expired promotions the day that passed.
