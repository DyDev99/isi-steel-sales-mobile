/// "Complete Visit": closes the deferred check-out, leaves the guided-visit
/// stack, and drains the outbound queue to
/// `POST /api/v1/mobile/visits/push`.
///
/// One function rather than two copies, because the Inventory completion
/// screen and the Quotation Builder both end a visit and had already drifted
/// into identical private methods.
///
/// ## The order is load-bearing
///
/// The push builds its batch by reading what is *already* in the database
/// ([VisitSyncRepositoryImpl] queries every `sync_status = 'pending'` row).
/// So the check-out has to be committed before the batch is assembled —
/// otherwise the one row this button exists to produce misses the very push it
/// triggers, and sits pending until something else syncs. Both call sites
/// previously fired the check-out with `unawaited`, which is exactly the shape
/// that loses the race.
///
/// ## The rep never waits for the network
///
/// Navigation happens between the two: the visit is complete the moment the
/// local write lands, and the push runs behind the rep. Sync is opportunistic
/// and never on the critical path — offline, `VisitSyncRepositoryImpl` returns
/// a `NetworkFailure` without leaving the device and every row stays pending
/// for the next attempt.
///
/// A failed push shows the rep nothing: they have already left the screen, and
/// the pending-record count on the dashboard
/// (`my_visits.dashboard.pending_sync`) already says what is still waiting. A
/// snackbar fired at a screen someone is walking away from is noise.
///
/// It is **logged**, though. "I pressed Complete Visit and no POST happened" has
/// several innocent explanations — nothing was pending, the device was offline,
/// the session had expired — and they are indistinguishable from a broken
/// button without a line saying which. Watch for `visit.checkout.*` and
/// `visit.push.*` together: the first says whether anything was queued, the
/// second what happened to it.
