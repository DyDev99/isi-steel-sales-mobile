/// Hands a destination to the device's map app with driving directions already
/// routed, so a rep gets guidance without retyping the shop's address.

/// **Deliberately does not import `dart:io`.** This app also builds for web
/// (GitHub Pages), and `dart:io` does not exist there — importing it would
/// break that target at compile time. `kIsWeb` + `defaultTargetPlatform` from
/// `foundation` give the same branch web-safely.
///
/// Candidates are tried most-specific first:
///
///  * **Android** — `google.navigation:` is the only scheme that begins
///    turn-by-turn guidance immediately instead of showing a route preview.
///  * **iOS** — Google Maps when the rep has it, so the experience matches
///    Android; Apple Maps otherwise, which is guaranteed to be present. Note
///    neither iOS scheme can auto-start guidance — Apple does not expose that
///    to third-party apps — so both land on the route preview with the
///    destination and driving mode already filled in, one tap from "Go".
///  * **Anything else** — the universal `google.com/maps/dir` HTTPS URL, which
///    also covers the web build and desktop.
///
/// Returns false when nothing could handle the request, so the caller can tell
/// the user rather than appear to do nothing.
