/// Fast, one-shot position reads that a continuous stream cannot give.
///
/// ## Why this exists beside `LocationTrackingService`
///
/// The check-in screen used to rely on `observe()` alone — a distance-filtered
/// position *stream*. A stream only emits when the device moves past the
/// filter, so a rep standing still inside a shop can wait indefinitely for a
/// first sample, and a high-accuracy stream indoors may never produce one.
/// That is the "Waiting for a GPS fix" dialog that never resolved.
///
/// This interface adds the three reads a stream cannot do:
///
/// * [lastKnownFix] — the OS's cached position, instant, for a first reading;
/// * [currentFix] — an explicit one-shot request with a hard timeout, which a
///   stationary device still answers, and which can fall back to a coarse
///   (Wi-Fi / cell) provider that works under a roof;
/// * [checkAvailability] — so "Location is off" and "Permission denied" are
///   reported as themselves rather than as an endless search.
///
/// Kept as its **own** interface rather than new members on
/// `LocationTrackingService`, so every existing implementer and test fake of
/// that interface keeps compiling. `GeolocatorTrackingService` implements
/// both, and `LocationTrackingCubit` picks this up from it automatically.
