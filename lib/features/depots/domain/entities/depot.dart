/// This is deliberately **not** a superset of `Lead` — it only ever comes
/// into being via sync from the SAP depot master
/// ([DepotRemoteDataSource]/`upsertFromSapPayload`). There is no local
/// constructor path for a rep to hand-create one; that would violate the
/// Won -> Submitted -> HQ Approved -> SAP-created entry rule.
/// [sapDepotId] is **nullable**: a depot registered in the field has no
/// SAP identity until it is approved and pushed to the ERP. It was non-null
/// while depots could only arrive by sync from SAP; now that a rep can
/// create one, `Draft` and `PendingApproval` records legitimately have none.
