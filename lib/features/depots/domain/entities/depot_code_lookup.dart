/// ## Why this is a sealed type and not a nullable depot
///
/// "Not found" and "could not ask" must never be presented the same way, and a
/// `PortalDepot?` invites exactly that collapse:
///
///  * **404 — the code does not exist.** Safe to offer to register the shop.
///  * **502 — the ERP could not be reached.** The depot may well exist. If
///    the app offers a registration here it creates a **duplicate business
///    partner in SAP**, which is expensive to unpick and invisible until
///    somebody reconciles the ERP.
///
/// Making them separate variants means a caller cannot accidentally treat the
/// second as the first — the switch will not compile until both are handled.
/// See `docs/feature/depot/mobile/mobile.md` §Statuses.
