/// Drives the guided material configurator one level at a time.
///
/// Every method here answers exactly one question the rep is currently being
/// asked — "which categories?", "what comes next for Profile Roofing?", "which
/// gauges exist for CAP 980 in PALM 100PPGL?" — and never more. There is
/// deliberately no "give me the whole tree" method: that would be the same
/// unbounded download this flow exists to avoid. The live master is 13,499
/// materials; nobody finds a roofing sheet by paging 6,750 pages.
///
/// The *hierarchy* (which steps, in which order, under which business label) is
/// server-owned and arrives as configuration, so merchandising can reorder or
/// relabel a category with no app release. The *values* at each level are
/// resolved against the same filter the terminal read uses, which is what makes
/// the flow dead-end free — an option that matches nothing is never returned,
/// and a count never promises twelve and delivers nine.
///
/// Two implementations satisfy this, chosen at registration:
///
///  * the platform's material selection API, the primary path; and
///  * the device's local Drift catalog, which keeps the finder working with no
///    connectivity.
///
/// They resolve the same [FilterSelection] through their own translation, so
/// neither can silently narrow differently from the other.
