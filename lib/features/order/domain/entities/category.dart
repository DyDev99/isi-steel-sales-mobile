/// Two things are deliberately separated here, because conflating them is what
/// made the previous version unable to grow:
///
///  * **How ISI sells** — the tree a rep navigates ("ISI Pipe" → "Square
///    Pipe"). Parents exist purely to group; only leaves carry products.
///  * **What SAP calls it** — [code], the `ProductGroup`/`MaterialGroupName`
///    this node maps onto. Renaming a branch for the sales team never touches
///    the SAP mapping, and a SAP regrouping never forces a UI redesign.
///
/// [name] is a [LocalizedText] rather than a `String`, so no widget ever needs
/// a translation lookup for a category label — the label *is* the data. That
/// is what makes a language switch a rebuild rather than a re-fetch.
