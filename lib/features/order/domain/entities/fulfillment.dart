/// replacement: the widget now renders them, the cart persists them, and the
/// quotation/sales-order line codec carries them to SAP. Nothing about the
/// shape changed, so the widget's rendering is untouched.
///
/// [PickupLocation] is deliberately *not* the same concept as a SKU's
/// `warehouseCode`. The warehouse is where the stock physically is (SAP master
/// data, on every product row); pickup location is what the customer agreed to
/// (a commercial term captured by the rep). The repository does not infer one
/// from the other, because SAP has published no plant→factory/branch mapping —
/// see the gaps section of the engineering report.
