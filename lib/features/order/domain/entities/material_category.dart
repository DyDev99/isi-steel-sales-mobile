/// mapping. This one models what stage zero of the finder actually answers:
/// SAP's `MaterialGroupCategory`, how many live materials sit behind it, and
/// whether a wizard has been defined for it at all.
///
/// The two extra fields are the whole reason for the separate type, and both
/// change what the UI may do:
///
///  * [materialCount] is worth showing — it tells the rep how big a haystack
///    they are walking into before they spend a tap.
///  * [hasPublishedSchema] tells the UI whether the first schema read will use
///    merchandising's published hierarchy. Categories without one are still
///    offerable: the selection API derives a safe, optional hierarchy for that
///    named category from its live material data.
