/// The catalog column a dynamic filter step narrows on.
///
/// This is the *only* hardcoded thing in the guided filter flow, and it has to
/// be: it's the closed set of attributes the material master physically
/// carries. SAP decides which of them a category exposes, in what order, and
/// under what business label ("Profile", "Coating Line", "Colour" all land on
/// real columns) — the app never decides that. Adding a genuinely new attribute
/// is a schema change on both sides, not a configuration change, which is
/// exactly why it lives in code.
///
/// ## Two vocabularies, one enum
///
/// The members below span **both** data sources the flow can run against:
///
///  * the platform's material selection API, whose `MaterialFilterField` enum
///    this mirrors ([wireName] is the exact string it sends and expects); and
///  * the device's local Drift catalog, whose columns the offline path groups
///    on.
///
/// They overlap but do not coincide, and pretending otherwise is how a step
/// silently narrows nothing. [isServerField] and [localFacet] say which is
/// which, per `docs/features/material-mobile-selection/business-logic.md`:
///
///  * SAP's material master has **no plant column**, so [warehouse] exists only
///    on the local path. There is no stock-location facet against the API.
///  * SAP does not return length, height, diameter or substance, so [length],
///    [height], [diameter] and [material] are local-only too.
///  * [materialType], [division], [priceGroup] and [rawThickness] are SAP
///    classifications the local catalog has no column for.
