/// ## What this is not
///
/// It is **not** a price. It carries no amount and no currency, and applying
/// one never changes the unit price of a line — it adds a separate free
/// quantity beside the paid one. That separation is the whole point: a rep
/// telling a customer "300 bags, and 15 come free" is making a different and
/// far more checkable promise than "a discount of about 5%".
///
/// ## Eligibility is not decided here
///
/// [tiers] describes the ladder; it does not decide whether this customer, on
/// this date, for this material, qualifies. That verdict comes from the
/// repository, which today reads a published static table and tomorrow reads
/// the pricing service. Re-deriving it in a widget would give the app a second
/// opinion, and the two would drift the first time a rule changed.
