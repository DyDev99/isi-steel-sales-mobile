/// A single line in the cart / quotation.
///
/// A line can be a plain catalog product or a **customized** one — same base
/// [product], but with category-specific [measurements], a surface
/// [appearance]/finish, an optional technical [drawingImagePath], and free-form
/// [customizationDescription]. Customized lines never merge with plain ones
/// (each customization is its own line).
///
/// ## The line owns its SKU identity, not a reference to "a product"
///
/// [product] is one `products` row, and a `products` row *is* a sellable SKU:
/// its id is `{code}-{warehouseCode}`, so [skuId] already pins down material
/// **and** stock location together. [skuCode], [materialCode] and
/// [stockLocationCode] name the three levels explicitly rather than leaving
/// callers to re-derive them from the id, which is how a "productId" starts
/// being treated as a generic product somewhere downstream.
