///  * `!sku.isAvailable` — refused a line outright when the last sync happened
///    to show nothing on hand;
///  * `quantity > availableQuantity` — refused any quantity above the synced
///    figure, which for a material from the selection API is `0`, because that
///    API supplies no on-hand quantity at all. Every line above zero failed,
///    and the rep saw "Only 0 available at ." for a perfectly orderable
///    material.
///
/// What remains is the one rule that is not about stock: a line must ask for a
/// positive quantity. A SKU that no longer resolves is still reported, because
/// that is an identity problem rather than an availability one.
