/// The local catalog already carries all seven of SAP's price tiers per SKU
/// (`prices.standard_price`, `wholesale_price`, `dealer_price`, `vip_price`,
/// `credit_price`, `cash_price`, plus any promotion), and [Customer] carries
/// SAP's `priceGroup`. What the repository does **not** have is the mapping
/// between them — SAP has published no `priceGroup` → tier table, and this app
/// is not the system of record for that decision.
///
/// So this use case deliberately does not guess. It resolves against
/// [PriceTier.standard], the tier the app has always quoted, and reports
/// [OutletPrice.isTierResolved] as false so callers can see that the outlet's
/// own tier was not applied.
///
/// **To complete this, SAP needs to supply** either a `priceGroup` → tier
/// mapping, or (better) a per-outlet price lookup. When it does, only
/// [_tierFor] and the datasource behind it change: every caller already asks
/// this question through this one type, so nothing above it moves.
