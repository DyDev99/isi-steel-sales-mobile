/// SAP's stock read for one material, as a badge.
///
/// ## Why this is not a number
///
/// `/materials/{material}/stock` answers a **band** — `"High"`, `"Medium"`,
/// `"Low"`, `"None"` — and never a quantity. There is no on-hand figure in the
/// payload to tap through to, which is the server's decision rather than a gap:
/// an exact count on a card is a number a rep reads as a promise the moment it
/// goes stale.
///
/// ## The states, and why they are these states
///
/// | [MaterialAvailability] | Badge | Meaning |
/// |---|---|---|
/// | absent | *nothing rendered* | never asked — the check costs a live SAP round trip and is spent on commitment |
/// | `checking` | spinner | asked, waiting |
/// | `available` + band | High / In stock / Low | SAP will accept the line, and this is how much |
/// | `available` + `none` | None on hand | SAP will accept the line, but there is nothing in the yard |
/// | `unavailable` | No stock | SAP will not accept the line |
/// | `unknown` | Stock unknown | the round trip failed — not a refusal |
///
/// Rendering "never asked" as "No stock" would be the worst mistake available
/// here: a rep would decline a sale on the strength of a question the handset
/// had not got round to asking.
///
/// ## Why `none` is not folded into "In stock"
///
/// SAP can answer `isSellable: true` with `band: "None"` — the ERP will take
/// the order, there is simply nothing on hand to fill it from today. That is a
/// real answer and a different one from [StockBand.unknown], which means SAP
/// reported no band at all. Both used to render as a green "In stock", which
/// told a rep there was stock when SAP had said the opposite. `none` now gets
/// the warning colour and its own label; `unknown` keeps the neutral fallback,
/// because inventing a level out of silence is the other half of the same
/// mistake.
