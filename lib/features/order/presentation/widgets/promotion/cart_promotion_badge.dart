/// The free-goods offer on a cart line, pinned to the card's top-right corner.
///
/// ## Why only free goods
///
/// A percentage discount already shows on the line, next to the unit price,
/// where a rep reads it against the number it modifies. Free goods have nowhere
/// like that to live: they change the *quantity*, not the price, and the paid
/// quantity sits in a stepper the rep is actively driving. Putting "+1 free"
/// inside that stepper would make the number they are adjusting disagree with
/// the number they are reading.
///
/// So this is the one promotion shape that earns its own corner. Percentage
/// discounts, clearance and monthly deals keep rendering exactly where they do
/// now.
///
/// ## Why the corner rather than a strip
///
/// The catalog card has room for [PromotionInlineBlock] — a full strip with a
/// progress bar, because a rep browsing there is deciding *whether* to buy. In
/// the cart they have already decided; the line is a commitment being checked.
/// A strip would push every cart line taller for information that is now a
/// confirmation rather than a prompt, and cart height is the whole ergonomic
/// budget on a screen a rep scrolls back through a dozen times.
///
/// The corner is also where a discount sticker sits on a physical shelf tag,
/// which is what a rep is used to reading.
///
/// ## What it says
///
/// "Buy 40 Free 1", taken verbatim from the tier. Not "5% off" — the two are
/// different promises and only one of them is checkable at the counter. A rep
/// saying "buy forty and one comes free" can be held to it; "about 2.4% off"
/// invites an argument about the arithmetic.
