/// What came off one line, and on whose authority.
///
/// **Independent of pricing, on purpose.** The percentage and the free-goods
/// ladder are both known the moment a line is added; the money is not known
/// until the pricing call returns. Tying the two together is what made a
/// correctly applied ten percent look like it had never been granted on any
/// unpriced line. A rep at a counter has to be able to say "ten percent, and
/// one in forty free" whether or not the total has arrived.
///
/// **One implementation, three screens.** The builder's cart rows, the
/// quotation preview and the sales-order lines all render this. Written three
/// times they would drift, and the first divergence a rep notices is the one
/// where the cart and the quotation disagree about what the customer is getting
/// — which is the moment they stop believing either.
///
/// Renders nothing at all for an undiscounted line. An empty discount slot on
/// every ordinary row would be noise on the busiest screen in the app.
