/// The one motion spec every stage of the guided configurator uses.
///
/// Centralised so category → family → specification → products all feel like
/// the same object moving, rather than four screens that each animate slightly
/// differently. Material's standard "shared axis" reading: the outgoing stage
/// fades and slides out, the incoming one fades and slides in from the leading
/// edge, with the container resizing rather than jumping.
///
/// ## Motion tokens, not local constants
///
/// The durations and curves come from [AppDurations] / [AppCurves].
/// `docs/skills/feature-ui-standard.md` §14 makes that a blocking rule, and the
/// reason is visible in this feature: the configurator used a local `260ms`
/// while the rest of the app moved at [AppDurations.medium], so a stage change
/// and the sheet it happened inside were animating at different speeds.
///
/// The shape of the motion is unchanged — this is the same shared-axis
/// transition, re-expressed in the app's vocabulary.
///
/// ## Reduce motion
///
/// Honoured, and it has to be: a shared-axis slide plus a resizing container is
/// precisely the combination a motion-sensitive rep should not be given, and
/// §14 lists it as blocking. With animations disabled the stage swaps
/// instantly — no slide, no fade, no resize — which is a legitimate rendering
/// of the same information rather than a degraded one.
