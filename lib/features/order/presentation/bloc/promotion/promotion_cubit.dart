///    verdict for 300 — that is the entire feature. A change of quantity
///    invalidates the entry rather than reusing it.
///  * **Debounced per material.** A rep holding `+` walks through forty
///    quantities; asking for forty verdicts would be forty round trips once
///    this is served by an API. Only the quantity they stop on is asked about.
