/// Wire → domain for the material selection surface.
///
/// Kept separate from `ProductModel` on purpose. That model round-trips the
/// *catalog sync* shape — nested pricing, per-warehouse stock, a `deleted`
/// tombstone. The selection API answers something narrower and differently
/// shaped, and running one deserialiser over both would mean inventing the
/// fields the second one does not carry.
///
/// What it does not carry is the whole point of this file:
///
///  * **no price of any kind.** No price list, no condition, no scale, no
///    currency. `priceGroup` is SAP's pricing *classification* — the bucket a
///    material sits in for condition lookup — and carries no amount. It is
///    read here as an attribute and never as money.
///  * **no on-hand quantity.** No stock level in units, no warehouse balance,
///    no ATP. Sellability is a separate live call, and the rep's own eyeball
///    estimate flows the other way, with a visit.
///
/// Both absences are rendered as absences: [ProductPricing.unpriced] and
/// `stockKnown: false`. Zeroing them would put "$0.00" and "out of stock" on a
/// card, which are claims rather than gaps, and a rep cannot tell a confident
/// wrong answer from a missing one.
