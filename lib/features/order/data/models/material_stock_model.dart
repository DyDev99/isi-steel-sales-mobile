/// Maps `/api/v1/mobile/materials/{material}/stock` onto [MaterialAvailability].
///
/// The endpoint answers the object envelope, so what arrives here is the `data`
/// block only:
///
/// ```json
/// {
///   "material": "1100000042",
///   "band": "High",
///   "isSellable": true,
///   "baseUnit": "KG",
///   "plants": [{"plant": "KMH2", "band": "High", "isSellable": true}],
///   "checkedAt": "2026-08-27T07:51:39.9213697+00:00"
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Two fields the entity has that this payload does not, and where they go:
///
/// * **[MaterialAvailability.status]** is derived from `isSellable`. The wire
///   has no status; SAP either will or will not accept a line.
///   [MaterialStockStatus.checking] is a client state the cubit emits while the
///   request is out, never something the server says.
/// * **[MaterialAvailability.checks]** stays empty, which is what the entity
///   already documents for a stock read. A band is not a chain of validations,
///   so [MaterialAvailability.summary] is empty too and
///   [MaterialAvailability.reason] correctly resolves to nothing — the badge
///   then falls through to its plant-list tooltip, which is the branch worth
///   having here anyway.
///
/// One consequence worth knowing: because `checks` is empty,
/// [MaterialAvailability.isInputIncomplete] is always false for a stock read.
/// That is honest rather than lossy — this endpoint takes no sales-area
/// parameters, so the `INPUT_VKORG` trap it guards against cannot occur.
