/// The one encoder/decoder for the `lines_json` blob shared by `quotations` and
/// `sales_orders`.
///
/// It exists because the two repositories had grown their own copies and they
/// had already drifted: the quotation encoder wrote a `customization` key and
/// the sales-order encoder did not, so converting a customized quotation into a
/// sales order silently dropped the measurements and the drawing. One codec
/// makes that class of bug unrepresentable rather than merely fixed.
///
/// ## The blob is a snapshot, not a foreign key
///
/// It used to hold `{productId, quantity, unit, discountPercent}` and rebuild
/// everything else by re-reading the catalog. Two things followed, both wrong:
///
/// 1. **Price moved.** `prices` is SAP master data replaced wholesale on sync,
///    so a saved quotation re-priced itself under the rep's feet while the
///    stored `total` stayed put.
/// 2. **Lines vanished.** The decoder did `if (product == null) continue`, so a
///    soft-deleted or re-keyed material erased its line from a document that
///    had already been shown to a customer — leaving totals that no set of
///    visible lines added up to.
///
/// So every line now carries its own SKU identity and money. The catalog is
/// still consulted, because a live row has the current image, dimensions and
/// stock the UI wants; but it is an enrichment, never the source of the
/// line's identity, and its absence downgrades the line rather than deleting
/// it (see [_tombstone]).
