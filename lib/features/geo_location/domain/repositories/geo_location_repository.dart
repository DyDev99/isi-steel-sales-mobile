/// bundle and there is no geographic endpoint to fall back to. The interface is
/// still written as if a remote existed — `ResultFuture`, failures, an explicit
/// [ensureSeeded] — so that adding a delta sync later changes one
/// implementation and no caller. That is the difference between "offline-first"
/// and "offline-only": the domain contract does not encode the absence of a
