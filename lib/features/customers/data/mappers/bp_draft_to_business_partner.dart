// bp_draft_to_business_partner.dart
//
// Turns the wizard's [BpCustomerDraft] into a [BusinessPartnerRequest].
//
// This is where the two vocabularies meet, and the differences are not
// cosmetic. Three of them change what SAP receives:
//
//  1. `City` and `District` are now *names*, not gazetteer codes. The old
//     payload sent `'city': cityCode`; the sample sends `"City": "Phnom Penh"`
//     and `"District": "Sen Sok"`. SAP's `ADRC-CITY1`/`CITY2` are free text
//     and the codes are ours, not SAP's — sending `1201` would put the code in
//     the address line a delivery driver reads. Names come from the gazetteer
//     via `GeoAddress`; the code is the fallback so an older draft still
//     submits rather than submitting blank.
//
//  2. `Language` is a SAP language key (`E`), not the app locale (`EN`).
//     `SapBpConst.defaultLanguage` is `'EN'`, which this endpoint would reject.
//
//  3. There are two search terms. The draft has one field, so `SearchTerm1`
//     is derived from the city — matching the sample, where it is the place
//     and `SearchTerm2` is the shop shorthand.
//
// Fields the draft carries that this endpoint has nowhere to put — `vatTin`,
// `faxNumber`, `contactPersonName`, `contactPersonRole`, `remark`, `title`,
// `attachments` — are deliberately not smuggled in as extra keys. See the
// wiring notes for where they have to go instead.
