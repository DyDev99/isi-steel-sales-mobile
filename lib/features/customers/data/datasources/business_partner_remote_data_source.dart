// The single network call for SAP BP registration.
//
// Replaced the three-call server-draft protocol (`POST draft`, `POST update`,
// `POST submit`). That protocol needed a `serverDraftId` before the rep could
// type anything, so the wizard's first action was a network call and the
// primary button stayed disabled until it returned — which meant a rep with no
// signal could not even start the form.
//
// With one write there is no id to obtain and no reason to be online before
// submit. `AddCustomerBloc` is now local state until the rep taps send.
