/// **Deliberately much smaller than [Customer].** A customer carries a credit

/// evidence slots, because SAP needs all of it before an order can be posted.
/// None of that applies here: nothing is invoiced to a non-customer, so there is
/// no credit to approve, no ledger to place them in, and no ERP record to keep
/// in step. What is left is identity — who they are and how to reach them — plus
/// the one field that gives the record its purpose.
///
/// That field is [linkedCustomerCode]. Without it a non-customer is an orphan
/// note in a phone: sales through them land against nobody, and the dealer who
/// actually carries the receivable gets no credit for the volume. With it, a
/// visit to a sub-dealer rolls up to the dealer it belongs to.
