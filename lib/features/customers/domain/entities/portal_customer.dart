/// ## Why this is a separate type from [Customer]
///
/// That endpoint lives on `/customers`, not `/mobile/customers`, and its shape
/// differs in five ways that all fail silently if you assume otherwise:
///
/// | Mobile | Portal (`by-code`) |
/// |---|---|
/// | `{ success, message, data, metadata, traceId }` | `{ data, meta }` |
/// | `customerCode` | `code` |
/// | `shopName` (localised) | `name` (not localised) |
/// | `statusDisplay` present | absent — localise `status` yourself |
/// | `creditLimit: { amount, currency }` | `creditLimit: 0.0` — a bare number |
/// | flat `city` / `latitude` | nested under `address` |
///
/// The integration guide is explicit that one parser must not serve both. This
/// type is deliberately small: it exists to answer "does this code exist?", not
/// to render a detail screen. Follow up with the mobile detail endpoint once the
/// platform id is known.
